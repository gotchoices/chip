          <summary>What is a CHIP?</summary>
          <p>A CHIP (Credit Hour In Pool) is a proposed unit for measuring value. It represents
             the value produced by one continuously applied hour of adult human work under
             standardized conditions: unskilled labor, balanced supply and demand, minimal
             capital equipment, and a worker of average functioning ability. It is designed to
             be independent of the volatility of traditional national currencies.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What is the current CHIP value?</summary>
          <p>The base CHIP value was estimated at <strong>$2.53 per hour</strong> in 2019 US
             dollars, using econometric analysis of panel data from 89 countries. Adjusted for
             inflation, today's estimated value is approximately
             <strong>$<span data-chip-value>---</span></strong>. See the
             <a href="value.html">CHIP Value</a> page for an interactive historical chart.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How is the CHIP value calculated?</summary>
          <p>The original study uses a Cobb-Douglas production function estimated from
             international data on GDP, capital stock, employment, wages, and hours worked.
             This yields the marginal product of labor for each country. A "distortion factor"
             measures how far actual wages deviate from this theoretical value. The CHIP value
             is then a GDP-weighted global average of the theoretical unskilled wage, adjusted
             for these distortions.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Why not just use minimum wage data?</summary>
          <p>Minimum wages are set by political processes and vary enormously between countries.
             They don't reflect the true economic value of labor in a balanced market. The CHIP
             methodology aims to estimate what unskilled labor would be worth in a frictionless
             global market without borders, tariffs, or political distortions.</p>

          <summary>What is MyCHIPs?</summary>
          <p><a href="https://mychips.org">MyCHIPs</a> is a proposed digital currency based
             on the CHIP unit of value. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, MyCHIPs are backed
             by the value of human labor and can be implemented without a central authority.

          <summary>Where can I find the source code and data?</summary>
          <p>All research code, data pipelines, original studies, and supporting documents are
             open source and available at
             <a href="https://github.com/gotchoices/chip">github.com/gotchoices/chip</a>.
             This includes the original R-based study, a Python reproduction, and a modular
             workbench for ongoing research.</p>

          <summary>How can I contribute to CHIP research?</summary>
          <p>We welcome researchers interested in contributing to CHIP valuation methodology.
             Whether you want to propose a new estimation approach, test alternative models,
             or improve the existing pipeline, we'd like to hear from you.
             <a href="contact.html">Contact us</a> to discuss collaboration. Funding may be
             available for bona fide research participants.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How often is the CHIP value updated?</summary>
          <p>The base econometric estimate is recalculated periodically as new international
             data becomes available (typically lagging 1&ndash;2 years). The daily value shown
             on this site is the base estimate adjusted for US CPI inflation, updated from
             Bureau of Labor Statistics data.</p>
