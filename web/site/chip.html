        <h1>A Message From The Founder: What's a CHIP?</h1>

        <p><strong>CHIP</strong> (noun): A proposed unit for measuring value, designed to be
           independent of the volatility associated with traditional world currencies.</p>

        <p>The CHIP was first suggested in my first book
           <a href="http://gotchoices.org/book/are.html">Got Choices</a> as a complementary
           currency that could be implemented without the need of a central bank, a large
           corporation or a centralized regulatory authority. The acronym stands for
           "Credit Hour In Pool" to indicate that a CHIP is meant to be indexed to human
           productivity.</p>

        <p>I later published <a href="http://gotchoices.org/mychips/intro.html">The MyCHIPs Papers</a>
           which explores a CHIP-based digital currency in more detail.
           <a href="http://gotchoices.org/mychips/definition.html">In that work</a> the CHIP
           is defined in a very specific way:</p>

        <h2>A CHIP is:</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Credit for the <em>value</em> produced by one continuously applied hour of adult human work;</li>
          <li>in such circumstance where there is neither a shortage nor a surplus of such willing labor available; and</li>
          <li>where the job can be reasonably understood with only minimal training and orientation; and</li>
          <li>without considering the added productivity due to the use of labor-saving capital equipment; and</li>
          <li>where the person performing the work has a normal, or average, functioning mind and body; and</li>
          <li>can communicate effectively as needed with others in his/her work; and</li>
          <li>where the task can be reasonably expected to produce a result or product that has value to other people.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>

        <p>In order to launch a viable digital currency based on CHIPs, someone has to figure
           out how many dollars, euros, or yen a CHIP is really worth. After all, a CHIP is
           meant to measure the value of unskilled human labor in a global context &mdash;
           independent of any single nation's currency fluctuations.</p>

        <p>This is the central research question of CHIP Central: <strong>What would one hour
           of baseline unskilled labor be worth in a frictionless global market without borders,
           tariffs, or distortions?</strong></p>

        <p>The original econometric study, using panel data from 89 countries over the period
           1992&ndash;2019, estimated the CHIP value at <strong>$2.53 per hour</strong> in 2019
           dollars. Adjusted for inflation, today's value is approximately
           <strong>$<span data-chip-value>---</span></strong>.</p>

        <h2>The MyCHIPs Currency</h2>

        <p>The CHIP is the basis for <a href="https://mychips.org">MyCHIPs</a>, a new kind
           of digital currency that:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Holds a more consistent value over time</li>
          <li>Is more efficient for consumers</li>
          <li>Is resistant to corruption and manipulation</li>
          <li>Is compatible with sound economic principles</li>
          <li>Is resistant to theft and loss</li>
        </ul>
