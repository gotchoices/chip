          <h3>The Future of Labor Value in an Age of Automation</h3>
          <div class="pub-meta">February 2026 &middot; Featured Paper</div>
          <p>Will AI and automation raise or lower the real value of human labor? This
             paper argues that the answer depends not on the technology itself but on
             <strong>who has access</strong> to it and at what price. Under distributed
             access, each hour of human work becomes more productive, reservation wages
             rise, and new forms of "no-collar" work emerge. Under concentrated access
             &mdash; enforced by regulatory capture &mdash; workers are excluded from
             the gains.</p>
          <p>The paper traces the argument from historical precedent through Baumol's
             cost disease to CHIP's evolution from a measured index to a market-discovered
             price, and makes the case that <strong>open AI is an economic prerequisite
             for the value of human time</strong>.</p>

          <h3>CHIP Value and Currency Inflation</h3>
          <div class="pub-meta">2025&ndash;2026 &middot; Analysis Paper</div>
          <p>Should CHIP track currency inflation over time? This paper examines the
             original study's deflation methodology, reveals that deflation cancels
             algebraically in the CHIP formula, and develops the concept of a "deflationary
             baseline" &mdash; the expectation that in a free economy, technology should
             make goods cheaper over time. Proposes a trailing-window production methodology
             that publishes CHIP in nominal current-year dollars.</p>
          <p><strong>Key result:</strong> Real CHIP is approximately stable at
             $2.80&ndash;$3.15/hr (2005&ndash;2022). Nominal CHIP rises with inflation,
             automatically hedging against currency devaluation &mdash; exactly the
             behavior a labor-anchored unit should exhibit.</p>

          <h3>Global Aggregation and Weighting Schemes</h3>
          <div class="pub-meta">2025&ndash;2026 &middot; Analysis Paper</div>
          <p>How should country-level CHIP values combine into a single global rate?
             This paper evaluates five weighting schemes &mdash; GDP, labor-force,
             unweighted, freedom-weighted, and HDI-weighted &mdash; through both
             philosophical analysis and empirical comparison. It addresses the
             circularity concern (does GDP-weighting just measure rich-country wages?)
             and publishes per-country multipliers from 0.04&times; to 2.39&times;.</p>
          <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> GDP-weighting ($2.68/hr) is defensible:
             it accounts for population, aligns with the CHIP definition's emphasis on
             productive efficiency, and its circularity is broken by the distortion
             factor. HDI-weighting ($2.20/hr) brackets the value from below.</p>

          <h3>Critical Review of the Original Study</h3>
          <div class="pub-meta">2025&ndash;2026 &middot; Review Paper</div>
          <p>A focused evaluation of the original CHIP valuation methodology: its
             theoretical framework (Solow-Swan / Cobb-Douglas), data sources (ILOSTAT,
             PWT, FRED), the innovative distortion factor approach, and how well each
             design choice aligns with the canonical CHIP definition. Identifies
             strengths (theoretically grounded, reproducible, strong definition
             alignment) and limitations (informal economy bias, weighting sensitivity,
             approximate capital separation).</p>
          <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> The $2.53 estimate is a credible first
             approximation. Post-review updates summarize how workbench studies have
             since addressed several of the open questions identified.</p>

          <p>This follow-up study evaluates the robustness of the original CHIP value
             computation, initially proposed to anchor the MyCHIPs currency to the global
             average of one hour of unskilled work. It incorporates ICT (Information and

          <p>Calculating a reasonable CHIP estimate requires analyzing mountains of data from
             markets across the world. This page extrapolates the CHIP valuation estimate over
             time by adjusting the base value for US Dollar inflation, providing a means of

        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/gotchoices/chip/tree/main/workbench">CHIP Workbench</a>
           is a modular Python analysis environment built to systematically test the
           assumptions, sensitivity, and robustness of the CHIP valuation methodology.
           Each study below is independently reproducible &mdash; see the

          <div class="pub-meta">2025 &middot; Workbench Study</div>
          <p>Develops a methodology for producing current-year CHIP estimates using
             PWT 11.0 data (2000&ndash;2023). Tests trailing-window smoothing, PWT bridge
             strategies for post-PWT years, and CPI-based extrapolation.</p>
          <p><strong>Key finding:</strong> 2022 nominal CHIP of $3.17/hr, closely matching
             the site's independent CPI-extrapolated value of $3.18. A 5-year trailing
             window reduces year-over-year volatility by 75%. CPI extrapolation is validated
             as a reliable bridge method between full recalculations.</p>

          <p><strong>Key finding:</strong> CHIP ranges from $1.67/hr (labor-weighted) to
             $2.85/hr (freedom-weighted) &mdash; a 51% spread, making weight choice a
             first-order methodological decision. GDP-weighting ($2.68/hr) is defensible:
             it produces the second-highest result and no single country dominates
             (USA = 24% weight). HDI-weighting is the most balanced alternative.</p>

             previously published CHIP values shift when new PWT releases revise
             historical national accounts.</p>
          <p><strong>Key finding:</strong> Mean upward revision of +5.9% between PWT
             versions, with early years showing extreme shifts (up to +37.6%). For the
             mature period (2002&ndash;2019), revisions average 3.8%. Recommendation:
             always use the latest PWT release and anchor to recent years with a trailing

             Identifies an 11-country stable panel with consistent coverage.</p>
          <p><strong>Key finding:</strong> Deflation cancels algebraically in the CHIP
             formula &mdash; both elementary and average wages are scaled by the same
             deflator, so nominal and deflated CHIP are mathematically identical. Real
             CHIP is approximately stable at $2.80&ndash;$3.15/hr (2005&ndash;2019),
             and nominal CHIP tracks the GDP deflator closely.</p>

          <h3>Alternative Valuation Models</h3>
          <div class="pub-meta">Research Opportunity &middot; Outline Available</div>
          <p>The current CHIP estimate relies on a single theoretical framework:
             the Cobb-Douglas production function with a distortion factor. How sensitive
             is the result to this choice? We have outlined &mdash; but not yet implemented
             &mdash; several alternative approaches:</p>
          <ul style="margin: 12px 0 16px 20px; color: var(--color-muted); font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.8; list-style: disc;">
            <li><strong>CES production functions</strong> &mdash; relax the unit-elasticity
                assumption of Cobb-Douglas to allow variable substitution between capital
                and labor</li>
            <li><strong>Stochastic frontier analysis</strong> &mdash; model country-level
                inefficiency directly rather than through a distortion ratio</li>
            <li><strong>Direct wage comparison methods</strong> &mdash; bypass the production
                function entirely and estimate CHIP from PPP-adjusted global wage
                distributions</li>
            <li><strong>Machine learning approaches</strong> &mdash; use nonparametric
                models to estimate the labor value surface, with interpretability constraints</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If any of these alternatives yields a materially different CHIP value, that
             would be important to know. If they converge on the same range, it strengthens
             confidence in the current estimate. Either outcome advances the research.</p>
