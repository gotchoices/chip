This note presents a conceptual framework to quantify the baseline value
 of the CHIP currency tied to the global average of one hour of unskilled
 work.
 Econometric estimates using panel data from 89 world countries over the
 period 1992-2019 suggest the CHIP value of $2.53 per hour.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The contemporary post-Bretton-Woods monetary system is increasingly criticized
 for its excessive reliance on several large central banks, which often
 pursue opaque and discretionary policies, poor handling of inflation, and
 inability to embrace modern technologies, such as cryptographic currencies.
 Responding to these challenges, Bateman (2022) proposes a novel money system
 anchoring means of payment to the value of time and using complementary
 currency nicknamed CHIP.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This acronym originally came from “Credit Hour In Pool.”
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Bateman argues that this novel system will offer a number of important
 improvements, including 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
maintaining a consistent value over time, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
offering better value and convenience to consumers, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
exhibiting greater resistance to theft and unethical manipulation by business
 or government, and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
being compatible with sound and sustainable economic principles, including
 free will and choice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For purposes of standardization, Bateman suggests indexing (or linking)
 the value of a CHIP to one hour of basic or unskilled work.
 The purpose of this research note is to quantify the baseline value of
 the CHIP.
 The first section of the note uses the theory of economic growth to conceptuali
ze the CHIP value as a distortion-free value of unskilled labor compensation
 at the global scale.
 The second section outlines the empirical approach to apply this definition
 to the panel data of 89 world countries over the period 1992-2019, collected
 from different public sources.
 The third section describes econometric estimates, including the main result
 of pinning the CHIP value to $2.53 per hour.
 Finally, the last section concludes and suggests several venues for future
 work.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section presents a simple economic framework whose core assumptions
 are based on a Solow-Swan growth modeling framework (Solow 1956, Swan,
 1956, Acemoglu 2009).
 The model deviates from this framework by allowing for labor skill and
 human capital differentiation (Hanushek and Kimko, 2000).
 We assume that each country is an open economy (i.e., there are no barriers
 to labor and capital migration inside and outside the country), producing
 and consuming a unique final good.
 The economy is in the steady state equilibrium, so all decisions are solutions
 to the static problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Households (Labor Supply)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The economy is inhabited by a large number of households (or economic agents),
 which supply labor hours, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, inelastically; there is no leisure.
 Within each country, agents have different labor skills, ranking from unskilled
 to highly skilled labor.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 be the labor skill level of a household type 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}=1$
\end_inset

 be the skill level of the highest skilled labor category.
 Countries also differ in terms of average level of households' human capital
 (e.g., average educational attainment), which we denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

.
 Under this assumption, the total value of the efficient (i.e., skill- and
 human capital- adjusted) labor in a country 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L_{s,j}=h_{j}\sum_{i}^{N}a_{i}L_{i,j},
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of household types according to their skill levels.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Firms (Labor Demand)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume that all firms in the economy are small, operate in a perfectly
 competitive environment, and have access to the same production function
 for the final good.
 The supply side of the economy can then be described by a representative
 firm and a production function.
 We assume that economy's production function is the Cobb-Douglas function
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Cobb-Douglas production function is the most common example of a production
 function used in macroeconomics (see, e.g., Acemoglu 2009).
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{j}=K_{j}^{\alpha_{j}}L_{s,j}^{1-\alpha_{j}},
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is the output of the good in the economy, 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is the aggregate capital endowment in the country owned by households,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the capital compensation share in the economy.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $y=Y/L_{s}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k=K/L_{s}$
\end_inset

 be the amount of output and capital per unit of efficient labor.
 Then the economy's production function per unit of efficient labor becomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y_{j}=k_{j}^{\alpha_{j}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Labor Market Equilibrium 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the economy's labor supply is inelastic, the labor market equilibrium
 is determined by the labor demand side resulting from firms' profit maximizatio
n problem:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\pi_{j}=K_{j}^{\alpha_{j}}L_{s,j}^{1-\alpha_{j}}-w_{s,j}L_{s,j},
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is the firm's profit and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is the unit cost of efficient labor (or the wage rate per unit of efficient
 labor).
 A firm's profit maximization requires
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\pi_{j}}{\partial L_{s,j}}=0\Longrightarrow\left(1-\alpha_{j}\right)K_{j}^{\alpha_{j}}L_{s,j}^{-\alpha_{j}}=\left(1-\alpha_{j}\right)k_{j}^{\alpha_{j}}=w_{s,j}=\bar{w_{s}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equation (5) is the standard result from the economic theory, which implies
 that labor compensation should equal the value of the marginal product
 of efficient labor.
 In the open economy equilibrium, wages are equalized across countries (Samuelso
n, 1948), so all wages equal the global marginal product of efficient labor,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{w_{s}}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The value of CHIPS for labor compensation
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:The-value-of"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us define the distortion factor, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{j}\equiv\frac{\left(1-\alpha_{j}\right)k_{j}^{\alpha_{j}}}{w_{s,j}}$
\end_inset

, as the ratio of the marginal product of efficient labor to efficient (i.e.,
 skill-weighted) labor compensation in the economyUnder the model assumptions,
 the distortion factor should be equal to one.
 In the real world, model assumptions will unlikely hold given barriers
 to labor and capital flows, regulatory distortions (e.g., minimum wage),
 and other market failures (such as, e.g., market power).
 This implies that the distortion factor will also differ from one.
 In practical terms, the distortion factor implies how much each economy's
 labor should be compensated (or taxed) to restore the labor market equilibrium
 defined by equation (5).
 We can then define the distortion-free value of labor compensation as the
 product of the distortion factor and the observed efficient labor compensation
 in the economy:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w_{s,j}^{e}=\theta_{j}w_{s,j}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Combining equation (6) with the definition of a CHIP (Bateman, 2022), we
 define the value of the CHIP as the distortion-free value of unskilled
 labor compensation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Estimation Approach 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We estimate the economies' production function using the following empirical
 specification:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\ln y_{j,t}=\alpha_{j}\ln k_{j,t}+\epsilon_{j,t},
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the vector of coefficients (or country fixed effects) to be estimated.
 Equation (7) is estimated by the ordinary least squares (OLS) with fixed
 effects estimation method and is implemented in R statistical software
 using

 To construct the efficient labor input, we assume that managers are the
 highest skill category.
 We calculate the skill-level of in each remaining category as the ratio
 of wages in this category relative to the managers.

The data on output, capital input, and human capital index come from the
 Penn World Tables (PWT) 10.0 database (Feenstra and Timmer, 2015).
 For measures of output, we use (i) real GDP at constant national prices
 (in a million of 2017 USD, variable
\emph on
 rgdpna
\emph default
) and (ii) output-side real GDP at current purchasing power parities (PPPs,
 in a million 2017 USD, variable
\emph on
 cgdpo
\emph default
).
 For measures of capital input, we use (i) capital stock at constant national
 prices (in a million of 2017 USD, variable
\emph on
 rnna
\emph default
) and (ii) capital stock at current PPPs (in a million 2017 USD, variable
\emph on
 cn
\emph default
).
 For a measure of human capital, we use the PWT human capital index (variable
 
\emph on
hc
\emph default
), based on years of schooling and returns to education.
 We distinguish between output and capital stock estimates using market
 exchange rates and PPPs because there is no consensus in the economics
 literature about which measure more adequately represents the supply side
 of the economy, especially in the poor countries.
 While PPPs better approximate values of tradable homogenous goods, they
 are also biased due to their poor ability to measure differences in quality
 across goods and services.
 This may result in a mechanical overvaluation of consumption bundles because
 the relative prices used for valuing the bundles differ from the transacted
 prices (Dowrick and Akmal, 2005).
 As physical capital input is poorly tradable on the secondary market due
 to significant sunk costs and its quality is difficult to measure, our
 preferred specification is using measures in constant national prices in
 millions of 2017 USD.

 dollar-denominated wages to their real values.
 After removing extreme outliers and observations with obvious measurement
 errors, the final dataset for estimating the marginal product of labor
 is an unbalanced panel comprising 2165 observations and covering 98 world
 countries from 1970 to 2019.
 Combining the marginal product of labor estimates' data with the wage data
 yields the final 451 observations covering 89 countries from 1992-2019.

 s a 45-degree line along which local labor markets show no distortions,
 and the country's marginal product of efficient labor equals its real wage.
 If the data point lies above the 45-degree line, the country's marginal
 product of efficient labor is less than the real wage.
 That is, workers in these countries are overpaid relative to market equilibrium.
 Conversely, if the data point lies below the 45-degree line, the country's
 marginal product of efficient labor exceeds real wage, and workers in these
 countries are underpaid relative to market equilibrium.
 We see that in most world countries, data points lie close to the 45-degree
 line, which indicates their labor markets are relatively undistorted.

Several countries (Brunei, Italy, Luxembourg) are outliers with unexpectedly
 large labor productivities, which are likely due to measurement errors.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 However, we also see that real wage greatly exceeds the marginal product
 of efficient labor in most OECD economies.
 This could be due to market distortions from minimum wage regulations,
 greater bargaining power of labor unions, or labor market segmentation
 leading to certain skill shortages and excessive wages.
 This could also be due to unobserved technological differences that could
 affect the marginal product of labor estimates, such as the productivity
 of capital in the information and communication services sector, which
 accounts for most of the productivity improvements in developed economies
 (Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh, 2008).
 Finally, estimates can be biased in developing countries with a large informal
 sector, where many small, unregistered establishments are missing from
 the ILO sample frame.

We see that, consistent with the evidence in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the average distortion factor using preferred specification is close to
 1, which indicates that labor markets are globally efficient.
 However, there is a significant dispersion across countries, with the distribut
ion of the DF I factor exhibiting a long right tail (Figure

, left panel).
 The average distortion factor assuming PPP conversion (DF IV) is very similar
 to our preferred specification, which indicates that using PPP rather than
 nominal exchange rate conversion has a small impact on the estimated DF
 factor value.
 Alternative definitions using more restrictive assumptions result in biased
 estimates of the distortion factor.
 The DF II factor is, on average, greater than one and has a much smaller
 dispersion than other measures.
 Assuming away capital in a country's production thus

We are now ready to answer the main question of this research note: how
 large countries' unskilled labor (elementary occupations) wages would be
 if market distortions were eliminated? Our preferred measure, DF I, offers
 the average local value of labor compensation of $2.5 per hour for unskilled
 labor (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:chipshist"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, right panel), whose values range between $0.047 (Rwanda) to $8.06 (Italy).
 Finally, we need to obtain the global value of labor compensation (i.e.,
 when labor mobility barriers are eliminated).
 To do so, we calculate the average value of labor compensation, weighted
 by each country's contribution to global GDP.
 This gives us the final value of unskilled labor compensation that underpins
 the CHIP index: $2.53 per hour.

Conclusions and Directions for Future Work

\begin_layout Standard
This note sets an important milestone in quantifying the value of a novel
 currency, the CHIP.
 Using a conceptual framework engrained in the theory of economic growth,
 we define the baseline CHIP value as a distortion-free value of unskilled
 labor compensation at the global scale.
 Applying this framework to the panel data of 89 world countries from 1992-2019,
 collected from different public sources, yields econometric estimates of
 the CHIP value at $2.53 per hour.
 While this number may seem low in the context of developed economies (estimated
 value is roughly eight times smaller than unskilled labor compensation
 in the United States), it is not surprising if put into the context of
 the global unskilled labor force, dominated by low and middle-income countries.
 While reasonably accurate, estimates in this note are only the first attempt
 to tackle the complex problem of calculating the base value of the CHIP.
 As with all new concept developments, several improvements can be made
 to obtain better estimates, especially for developed economies where larger
 discrepancies between actual unskilled wages and theoretical predictions
 have been found.
 They include, but are not limited to (i) endogenizing labor supply decisions
 in the context of labor-leisure choice across time (see, e.g., Turnovsky,
 2000), (ii) explicitly incorporating technological differences, especially
 the value of information and communication technology capital across countries
 (Jorgenson, 2005), and addressing measurement errors affecting the quality
 of labor productivity and earnings data related to regional disparities
 and prevalence of informal economy.
