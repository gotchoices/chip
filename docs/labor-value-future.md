# The Future of Labor Value in an Age of Automation

## Purpose

This paper explores how artificial intelligence and automation might affect the real value of human labor over the coming decades, and what this means for labor-anchored value systems like CHIP.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Question
As AI and robotics increasingly perform tasks currently done by humans, will the economic value of human labor increase or decrease?

### 1.2 Why This Matters for CHIP
CHIP is anchored to the value of one hour of nominal unskilled labor. If that value trends toward zero, CHIP loses its meaning as a stable reference. If that value increases, CHIP becomes more valuable. Understanding likely trajectories helps assess CHIP's long-term viability.

### 1.3 Scope
This paper considers market-based scenarios only. We do not consider government redistribution schemes (e.g., UBI) as solutions, because they do not address the fundamental economic question—they merely obscure it by ignoring the liability side of the ledger (i.e. who pays).

## 2. The Standard Narrative: Labor Becomes Less Valuable

### 2.1 The Supply/Demand Argument
If AI can perform most tasks:
- Demand for human labor falls
- Supply of human labor remains constant (population)
- Wages fall as workers compete for remaining jobs
- In the limit, human labor approaches zero value

### 2.2 Historical Precedent
Previous waves of automation (agriculture, manufacturing) did displace workers, but:
- New industries emerged to absorb displaced workers
- Overall living standards rose
- Labor remained valuable, just in different forms

### 2.3 Why AI Might Be Different
The counterargument: AI is general-purpose. Unlike tractors (which only farm) or looms (which only weave), AI can potentially do *any* cognitive task. If true, there may be no "new industries" for humans to flee to.

## 3. The Contrarian View: Labor Becomes More Valuable

### 3.1 The Reservation Wage Argument
The minimum wage someone will accept depends on their alternative. Today, the alternative to work is poverty. But if basic goods become abundant (through automation), the alternative to work becomes leisure.

**Key insight**: In abundance, human labor becomes precious precisely because no one needs to provide it.

### 3.2 The Back Massage Thought Experiment
Consider two scenarios:

**Scenario A (Scarcity)**: Worker is hungry. They'll give you a massage for enough money to buy dinner.

**Scenario B (Abundance)**: Worker's needs are met. They're enjoying leisure. You must offer something genuinely compelling to draw them away.

In Scenario B, the same hour of labor costs *more*, not less.

### 3.3 What Creates Abundance Without Redistribution?
For Scenario B to emerge in a free market:
- Workers must own productive capital (AI, robots) directly
- Or, workers must provide something AI cannot
- Or, new forms of value exchange emerge that we cannot yet predict

### 3.4 Cross-Country Evidence Today

We need not speculate entirely—we can observe the reservation wage effect across countries *today*:

**The US case**: American workers command higher wages than workers in developing countries doing equivalent tasks. Why? Not solely because of productivity differences. A significant factor is that American workers have *alternatives*:
- Higher baseline standard of living
- More leisure options and social safety nets
- Greater opportunity cost of working

**The implication**: In a country where abundance already exists (relative to global baseline), labor costs more. Workers with comfortable alternatives require more compensation to give up their time.

**Extrapolating to AI-driven abundance**: If automation raises global living standards toward what wealthy countries enjoy today, we would expect:
- Reservation wages to rise globally
- The "floor" of acceptable compensation to increase
- Human time to become more precious, not less

This is not a guarantee—it depends on whether abundance is distributed or concentrated. But it demonstrates that the "labor becomes more valuable" scenario is not merely theoretical; it has empirical precedent.

## 4. The Bifurcation Hypothesis

### 4.1 Two Categories of Labor
Rather than all labor moving in one direction, we may see bifurcation:

| Category | Examples | AI Capability | Human Labor Value |
|----------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Commoditized tasks** | Data entry, driving, stacking | Full automation possible | Approaches zero |
| **Human-presence tasks** | Massage, caregiving, artisanal craft, authentic experience | Automation impossible or undesirable | Potentially increases |

### 4.2 Why Human Presence Might Remain Valuable
Some value is intrinsic to *human-ness*:
- A massage from a human feels different than from a machine (even if technically identical)
- "Handmade" and "artisanal" command premiums over machine-made
- Human judgment and presence in caregiving (elderly, children) may be preferred
- Art and entertainment may value human creators

### 4.3 The "Authenticity Premium"
As AI-generated content floods the market, human-created content may become *more* valuable due to scarcity and authenticity. Just as vinyl records became premium when digital was "free," human labor may become premium when AI labor is ubiquitous.

## 5. The Capital Ownership Question

### 5.1 Why Ownership Matters
The key variable determining which scenario dominates is: **Who owns the AI?**

- If ownership is concentrated → Workers must compete for remaining jobs → Wages fall
- If ownership is distributed → Workers have capital income → Reservation wages rise

### 5.2 Market Mechanisms for Distributed Ownership
Without redistribution, how might ownership distribute?

**Direct purchase**: Individuals buy AI tools, as they buy smartphones today. Ownership follows those who save and invest.

**Labor-capital substitution**: Workers use AI to multiply their own productivity, earning more per hour rather than being replaced.

**Cooperative structures**: Worker-owned enterprises own AI collectively, distributing returns to worker-members.

**New asset classes**: Perhaps AI creates new forms of value that everyone can own (like attention, data, or reputation).

### 5.3 The Self-Ownership Parallel
Today, everyone owns their own labor by default. This is the most distributed "capital" that exists. The question is whether AI capital can become similarly distributed, or whether it will concentrate like land and factories historically have.

### 5.4 The Regulatory Paradox

A counterintuitive dynamic emerges when considering regulation:

**Heavy regulation favors concentration:**
- Compliance costs (lawyers, audits, safety certifications) create barriers to entry
- Only well-resourced incumbents can navigate complex regulatory landscapes
- Small innovators are locked out; large corporations consolidate
- Historical parallel: telecom regulation produced Ma Bell; banking regulation produced "too big to fail"

**Open-source and permissive environments distribute capability:**
- When underlying technology is freely available, competitive advantage shifts from *owning* the tools to *applying* them creatively
- Low barriers to entry enable many small players
- Historical parallel: the internet's open protocols enabled unprecedented innovation and distributed economic opportunity

**The policy implication:**
If CHIP's long-term viability depends on distributed capital ownership (Section 5.1), then regulatory environments that favor open-source AI and low barriers to entry are more favorable than those that concentrate AI in the hands of a few super-corporations.

This does not require government redistribution—it merely requires government to *refrain* from creating barriers that entrench incumbents. The difference is crucial: one involves taking and giving; the other involves simply not blocking.

**Guardrails vs. barriers:**
Some regulation is sensible (e.g., safety standards for medical AI). The question is whether regulation is designed to:
- Prevent genuine harm (narrow, specific rules), or
- Protect incumbents under the guise of safety (broad, expensive compliance regimes)

The former can coexist with distributed ownership; the latter tends to concentrate it.

## 6. Implications for CHIP

### 6.1 If Labor Value Declines
CHIP would decline in real terms. One CHIP would buy fewer goods over time. CHIP would still track the (declining) value of human labor, but it would no longer serve as a stable store of value.

### 6.2 If Labor Value Increases (or Bifurcates)
CHIP would increase or remain stable in real terms. The specific type of "unskilled labor" in the CHIP definition might shift (from box-stacking to human-presence tasks), but the concept remains valid.

### 6.3 The CHIP Definition's Flexibility
The CHIP definition specifies labor that:
- Requires minimal specialized training
- Does not depend on capital equipment for productivity
- Can be performed by an average adult

This definition is agnostic to *what* the task is. If the "unskilled" tasks of 2050 are different from 2024, CHIP can still measure them.

### 6.4 Potential Adjustments
If automation fundamentally changes labor markets, the CHIP methodology might need to:
- Specify "human-presence" tasks explicitly
- Exclude fully automatable tasks from the reference category
- Or, accept that CHIP measures a declining real value (honestly reflecting economic reality)

## 7. Scenarios and Predictions

### 7.1 Scenario A: Gradual Transition (Most Likely?)
AI augments human labor more than replacing it. New jobs emerge. CHIP evolves to track the changing nature of baseline work. Value remains relatively stable.

### 7.2 Scenario B: Rapid Displacement
AI replaces human labor faster than new roles emerge. Without distributed capital ownership, wages collapse. CHIP declines toward zero. CHIP becomes a historical artifact.

### 7.3 Scenario C: The Leisure Premium
AI generates abundance. Those with capital ownership enjoy leisure. Human labor becomes scarce and premium. CHIP increases in real terms.

### 7.4 Scenario D: Bifurcation
Commoditized labor loses value; human-presence labor gains value. CHIP's value depends on which category "unskilled" falls into.

---

## 8. Conclusions

### 8.1 Summary
The future of labor value under AI is genuinely uncertain. Plausible arguments exist for both decline and increase. The outcome depends on:
- How general AI capabilities become
- How capital ownership is distributed (through market mechanisms, not redistribution)
- Whether the regulatory environment favors open access or incumbent concentration
- Whether human-presence work retains intrinsic value
- Whether new forms of valuable human contribution emerge

### 8.2 Implications for CHIP
CHIP does not require labor value to be constant. It requires labor value to be *meaningful*—measurable, universal, and honest. If labor value changes, CHIP should reflect that change.

### 8.3 The Case for Labor-Anchoring Despite Uncertainty
Even with uncertainty about future labor value, CHIP remains preferable to fiat currency because:
- Fiat currency is subject to arbitrary manipulation; labor value is not
- Labor is universal; everyone has it
- If labor value changes, it changes for real reasons (technology, demographics), not political whim

### 8.4 Open Questions
- Can "unskilled labor" be defined in a way that is robust to automation?
- Should CHIP specify human-presence tasks explicitly?
- How should MyCHIPs communicate if CHIP's real value is declining over time?
- Does MyCHIPs have a stake in advocating for open-source AI and low regulatory barriers—not as a political stance, but as a condition for its own long-term viability?
