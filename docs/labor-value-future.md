# The Future of Labor Value in an Age of Automation

## Purpose

This paper argues that AI and automation will raise — not lower — the real
value of human labor, provided that the underlying technology remains open
and accessible.  It presents a logical case for why open access to AI is an
economic prerequisite for labor value, and by extension for the long-term
viability of labor-anchored value systems like CHIP.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Question

As AI and robotics increasingly perform tasks currently done by humans,
will the economic value of human labor increase or decrease?

This is not an academic question for CHIP.  CHIP is anchored to the value
of one hour of nominal unskilled labor.  If that value trends toward zero,
CHIP loses its grounding.  If it rises, CHIP becomes a more robust unit of
account.  The trajectory matters.

### 1.2 Why This Matters for CHIP

CHIP's long-term viability rests on two propositions:

1. **Labor has measurable economic value.**  If AI makes human labor
   worthless, CHIP measures nothing.
2. **That value is stable enough to anchor a unit of account.**  Wild
   swings in labor value undermine CHIP's usefulness as a reference.

This paper argues that both propositions hold — but only under specific
conditions regarding technology access.

### 1.3 Scope and Thesis

This paper considers **market-based outcomes only**.  We do not consider
government redistribution schemes (e.g., UBI) as solutions because they do
not address the fundamental economic question — they merely obscure it by
ignoring the liability side of the ledger (i.e., who pays).

**Thesis:** AI and automation amplify human labor productivity.  If the
tools are universally accessible **at free-market prices**, workers capture
the productivity gain, work fewer hours to meet their needs, and demand
higher compensation for their remaining time.  Labor value rises.  If the
tools are concentrated in the hands of a few — or available only at
monopoly/cartel prices that extract the surplus — workers are excluded from
the gains and must compete for remaining jobs at whatever rate the power
structure dictates.  Labor value falls.

The fork in the road is **competitive access**, not technology.  And the
primary threat to competitive access is regulatory capture that entrenches
incumbents, because the technology itself naturally trends toward open and
cheap.

---

## 2. The Pessimistic Narrative

*Present the standard "robots take all the jobs" argument fairly before
arguing against it.*

### 2.1 The Supply/Demand Argument

If AI can perform most tasks:
- Demand for human labor falls
- Supply of human labor remains constant (population)
- Wages fall as workers compete for remaining jobs
- In the limit, human labor approaches zero value

This argument is simple, intuitive, and dominates popular media coverage.

### 2.2 Historical Precedent

Previous waves of automation (agriculture, manufacturing) did displace
workers, but:
- New industries emerged to absorb displaced workers
- Overall living standards rose
- Labor remained valuable, just in different forms

The agricultural share of US employment fell from ~80% (1800) to ~2%
(2020).  Yet agricultural workers did not become permanently unemployed —
they moved into manufacturing, then services.  Each transition took
decades and caused real hardship, but the long-run outcome was higher
wages, not lower.

### 2.3 Why AI Might Be Different

The counterargument: AI is **general-purpose**.  Unlike tractors (which
only farm) or looms (which only weave), AI can potentially perform *any*
cognitive task.  If true, there may be no "new industries" for humans to
move to.  Every sector is simultaneously automated.

This is the strongest version of the pessimistic case.  It deserves a
serious answer, which we provide in Section 3.

### 2.4 Where the Narrative Goes Wrong

The supply/demand argument treats labor as a commodity whose demand can
fall to zero.  But it ignores two forces:

1. **Productivity amplification** — AI doesn't just replace workers; it
   makes remaining workers vastly more productive.  A farmer with a tractor
   doesn't compete with a tractor.  They *use* the tractor to produce 100x
   more than a farmer with a hoe.  Section 3 develops this.

2. **The reservation wage** — The supply/demand argument assumes workers
   will accept any wage, however low.  In practice, workers with
   alternatives (savings, leisure, other opportunities) have a floor below
   which they refuse to work.  If productivity gains raise living
   standards, that floor rises.  Section 3.2 develops this.

The pessimistic narrative correctly identifies that *demand for unaugmented
human labor* may fall.  But it incorrectly concludes that the value of
*human time* falls.  These are different things.

---

## 3. The Productivity-Amplification Argument

*The core positive case: AI amplifies labor rather than replacing it —
but only if tools are accessible.*

### 3.1 Tools Amplify Labor; They Don't Replace It

Every major technological advance in history has amplified human labor
productivity:
- The plow: one farmer feeds dozens instead of one family
- The printing press: one author reaches millions instead of dozens
- The automobile: one driver covers 500 miles instead of 30
- The computer: one analyst processes millions of records instead of
  hundreds

In each case, the tool did not make the human irrelevant.  It made each
hour of human effort vastly more productive.  The human *with* the tool
outcompetes the human *without* it — but both remain economically active.

**The AI parallel:** A cleaner with AI-managed logistics serves 10 clients
per day instead of 3.  An electrician with AI diagnostics completes jobs in
half the time.  A small farmer with AI-optimized planting yields 3x more
per acre.  In each case, the worker earns more per hour, not less.

The key condition: **the worker must have access to the tool at
competitive prices.**  A farmer with no tractor is worse off when
competitors have tractors.  A farmer who must rent a tractor at a price
that absorbs all the productivity gain is no better off — they have
"access" in name but capture none of the surplus.  The technology itself is
neither good nor bad for labor — what matters is whether the worker can
obtain it at free-market prices that reflect actual cost, not monopoly
rents.  Section 4 develops this fork.

### 3.2 The Reservation Wage Mechanism

The minimum wage someone will accept depends on their alternative.

- When the alternative is poverty, workers accept subsistence wages.
- When the alternative is comfortable leisure (because basic needs are
  met through modest, AI-amplified work), workers demand more.

This is the **reservation wage** — the floor below which a worker refuses
to sell their time.  It rises with prosperity.

**The mechanism applied to AI:**
1. AI amplifies productivity → workers meet basic needs with fewer hours
2. With needs met, remaining hours are leisure
3. To draw a worker away from leisure, you must offer more
4. Wages per hour *rise*, even as total hours worked may *fall*

The total income may or may not change.  But the *per-hour value of labor*
increases, which is what CHIP measures.

### 3.3 The Back Massage Thought Experiment

**Scenario A (Scarcity):** Worker is hungry.  They'll give you a massage
for enough money to buy dinner.

**Scenario B (Abundance):** Worker's needs are met through a few hours of
AI-amplified work per week.  They're enjoying their afternoon.  You must
offer something genuinely compelling to draw them away from leisure.

In Scenario B, the same hour of labor costs *more*, not less.

Note: the worker in Scenario B isn't idle or dependent.  They *work* — but
only a little, because each hour of their AI-amplified labor is so
productive.  The rest of their time is theirs.  This is the contrarian
outcome: abundance makes labor scarce and therefore valuable.

### 3.4 Cross-Country Evidence Today

We need not speculate entirely.  The reservation wage effect is observable
across countries *right now*.

**The US case:** American workers command higher wages than workers in
developing countries doing equivalent tasks.  Why?  Not solely because of
productivity differences.  A significant factor is that American workers
have *alternatives*:
- Higher baseline standard of living
- More leisure options
- Greater opportunity cost of working

**The data:** The CHIP weighting study (see `docs/weighting-analysis.md`)
found country-level multipliers ranging from 0.04× (Egypt) to 2.39×
(Switzerland).  Workers in prosperous countries are valued at 10–60× more
per hour than workers in poor countries doing comparable tasks.
Productivity differences explain part of this gap, but not all — the
distortion factor (θ) already adjusts for productivity.  The residual
reflects reservation wages, institutional quality, and bargaining power —
all of which correlate with prosperity.

**The implication:** In countries where abundance already exists (relative
to the global baseline), labor costs more.  If automation raises global
living standards toward what wealthy countries enjoy today, we would expect:
- Reservation wages to rise globally
- The "floor" of acceptable compensation to increase
- Human time to become more precious, not less

### 3.5 Baumol's Cost Disease: The Historical Trend

William Baumol observed in 1966 that labor-intensive services resist
productivity gains.  A string quartet still requires four musicians playing
for 30 minutes.  A haircut still takes 30 minutes.  Caregiving, teaching,
massage, and artisanal craft are structurally labor-intensive.

As technology drives down the cost of manufactured goods, these
labor-intensive services become *relatively more expensive*.  This is
usually discussed as a problem ("cost disease").  But from the perspective
of labor value, it is a feature: **the real price of human time rises
relative to goods.**

The CHIP inflation-tracking study (see `docs/inflation-tracking.md`)
confirmed this pattern empirically.  When prices are denominated in CHIPs
(labor-hours), manufactured goods become cheaper over time while personal
services hold steady or rise.  This is Baumol's effect in action — and it
is a long-run tailwind for labor value.

**Why this matters for CHIP:** Even if AI automates commodity production
entirely, it cannot automate the *human presence* component of
labor-intensive services.  A robot massage may be technically competent,
but consumers demonstrably pay a premium for human touch.  As commodity
prices fall toward zero and service prices hold, the share of economic
activity represented by human labor *rises* in real terms.

## 4. The Access Fork

*The central thesis: the same technology produces opposite outcomes
depending on who controls it.*

### 4.1 Same Technology, Two Opposite Outcomes

AI is not inherently good or bad for labor.  It is an amplifier.  The
question is: whose labor does it amplify?

If **everyone** has access to AI tools **at competitive prices**, each
worker becomes vastly more productive and captures the gain.  Abundance
follows.  Reservation wages rise.  Labor value increases.

If access is **denied or priced at monopoly/cartel rates**, the tool owners
capture all the productivity gains.  Everyone else must compete for
whatever work the owners deign to offer, at whatever terms the owners
dictate.  Wages fall.  Labor value decreases.

Note that "access at monopoly prices" is economically equivalent to no
access at all.  If a platform charges 90% of the surplus for use of its AI,
the worker is technically "using" the tool but capturing almost none of the
benefit.  The test is not whether workers *can* use AI, but whether they
can use it at prices set by competition — where multiple providers compete
and margins reflect actual costs, not market power.

This is not a spectrum.  It is a fork — a structural question whose answer
determines the direction of labor value.

### 4.2 Path A: Distributed Access — Labor Value Rises

When AI tools are universally accessible at competitive prices (like
smartphones, the internet, or hand tools):

1. **Workers amplify their own productivity.**  A self-employed
   tradesperson uses AI scheduling, diagnostics, and logistics to serve
   more clients per day — and keeps the gains because the tools cost a
   fraction of the surplus they generate.
2. **Small businesses compete with large ones.**  The cost advantage of
   scale shrinks when the tools are free or cheap.  A solo contractor
   with a $50/month AI suite competes with a corporation's $50M platform.
3. **Workers bargain from strength.**  With their own productive capacity,
   they don't need to accept exploitative terms from any single employer
   or platform.
4. **Reservation wages rise.**  Workers who can meet their needs in 20
   hours per week won't sell the other 20 cheaply.
5. **New forms of work emerge.**  History shows that when tools are
   distributed at low cost, people invent uses no one anticipated (the
   internet produced careers that didn't exist in 1990).

In this path, the CHIP value rises because the same hour of human time
commands a higher price.  The worker owns their own labor *and* can obtain
the tools that amplify it at prices set by open competition.

### 4.3 Path B: Concentrated Access — Labor Value Falls

When AI tools are controlled by a small number of entities — whether
through outright exclusion or through monopoly/cartel pricing that
extracts the surplus:

1. **Workers are excluded from productivity gains.**  The technology
   exists but the worker either can't use it or can't afford it at prices
   that leave any margin.
2. **Platform monopolies extract surplus.**  A gig worker whose AI
   logistics are controlled by a platform must accept the platform's
   terms.  The platform captures 80% of the productivity gain; the worker
   gets 20% — or less.  The worker has "access" but no benefit.
3. **Workers compete for access.**  Instead of owning tools, workers bid
   for the right to use them, driving their own compensation down.
4. **Extractive dynamics persist.**  The power structure dictates terms.
   The many must do whatever the few allow, at whatever rate the few
   offer.  This is the modern equivalent of sharecropping: the worker
   does the labor, the platform owns the tools, and the split is
   whatever the platform decides.
5. **Reservation wages stagnate or fall.**  Without independent
   productive capacity at affordable cost, workers have no leverage.
   The alternative to bad work is no work.

In this path, the CHIP value falls because workers cannot bargain for
their time.  They own their labor but lack affordable access to the tools
that make it valuable.

### 4.4 The Hinge Variable Is Access, Not Technology

The technology itself is the same in both paths.  AI capabilities advance
regardless.  The question is purely structural: **can workers obtain the
tools at prices set by free-market competition?**

This reframes the entire "AI and jobs" debate.  The right question is not
"will AI take jobs?" — it's "will workers have access to AI at competitive
prices?"  Nominal access behind a monopoly paywall is not access.  The
test is whether the market for AI tools is itself free and competitive —
multiple providers, low switching costs, open standards, no artificial
barriers to entry.  If yes, labor value rises.  If no, labor value falls.
Everything else is secondary.

## 5. Why Concentration Happens: The Regulatory Paradox

*The primary mechanism of concentration is not market dynamics but
regulatory capture.  The advocacy case for open AI.*

### 5.1 Technology Naturally Trends Toward Open and Cheap

Left to market forces alone, technology tends to distribute:

- **Moore's Law:** Computing power halves in price every ~18 months.
  Supercomputer capacity from 2010 fits in a $1,000 laptop in 2025.
- **Open source:** The most powerful AI models (LLaMA, Mistral, Stable
  Diffusion) are open-source.  State-of-the-art capability is available
  to anyone with consumer hardware.
- **Commoditization:** What was cutting-edge proprietary technology
  becomes commodity within 5–10 years.  Cloud computing, smartphones,
  GPS — all followed this arc.

**The cost floor is visible.**  In a competitive market, the price of AI
converges to three components:

1. **Amortized cost of hardware** — chips, servers, and devices that
   follow well-known cost curves (Moore's Law, Wright's Law for
   manufacturing scale).
2. **Cost of energy** — electricity to run the hardware, itself a
   commodity traded on open markets.
3. **Competitive return on capital** — the profit margin required to
   attract investment into AI infrastructure.  In competitive commodity
   markets, this is typically 3–7% — enough to justify the investment,
   not enough to extract rents.

That's it.  There is no secret ingredient, no scarce raw material, no
irreplaceable human genius in the marginal cost of running an AI model.
Training a frontier model is expensive today (tens of millions of
dollars), but *inference* — actually using the model — costs a fraction
of a cent per query and falling.  Once a model is trained, serving it is
hardware + electricity + a normal business margin.

This means the "natural" price of AI access, in a competitive market, is
low and declining.  The third term — return on capital — is important: no
one is arguing that AI providers should operate at cost.  Profit is the
incentive that builds data centers and improves models.  But in a
competitive market, that profit is modest (single-digit percentages), kept
in check by competitors who will undercut any provider charging
significantly more than the actual cost of service.

If someone is charging 10× or 100× the hardware-plus-energy-plus-margin
cost, the excess is not "the cost of AI" — it is a monopoly rent.  The
distinction matters: monopoly rents can be sustained indefinitely through
market power; competitive margins cannot grow, because rivals enter and
undercut.

The natural trajectory of AI is toward universal access at commodity
prices.  You don't need government to distribute it.  You need government
to *not block* distribution — and not to create the market power that
enables monopoly pricing.

### 5.2 Heavy Regulation Favors Concentration

A counterintuitive dynamic: regulation intended to "protect" workers or
"ensure safety" often achieves the opposite:

- **Compliance costs create barriers to entry.**  Lawyers, auditors,
  safety certifications, and licensing fees cost millions.  Only
  well-resourced incumbents can afford them.
- **Small innovators are locked out.**  A startup with a better AI tool
  cannot compete if deploying it requires a two-year, $10M regulatory
  approval process.
- **Incumbents write the rules.**  Large corporations actively lobby for
  complex regulation because they can afford compliance and their
  competitors cannot.  This is *regulatory capture* — using the
  machinery of government to entrench market position.

Historical parallels:
- **Telecom:** Heavy regulation produced Ma Bell — a single monopoly
  controlling all telephone service for decades.  Deregulation in the
  1980s produced competition, lower prices, and innovation.
- **Banking:** Post-2008 regulation produced "too big to fail" — a small
  number of mega-banks that are effectively government-guaranteed.  Small
  community banks disappeared by the thousands.
- **Pharmaceuticals:** FDA approval costs average $2.6 billion per drug.
  Only large pharma companies can play.  Generic manufacturers are delayed
  by years through regulatory and legal maneuvering.

### 5.3 Open Environments Distribute Capability

When technology is freely available:

- **Competitive advantage shifts** from *owning* the tools to *applying*
  them creatively.  Everyone has the same hammer; the best carpenter wins.
- **Low barriers to entry** enable many small players, each serving
  niches that large corporations ignore.
- **Innovation accelerates** because experimentation is cheap and failure
  is affordable.

Historical parallel:
- **The internet's open protocols** (TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP) enabled the most
  distributed economic opportunity in history.  No one needed permission
  to build a website, start a business, or publish content.  The result
  was an explosion of economic activity that no central planner could
  have designed.
- **Open-source software** (Linux, Apache, Python, TensorFlow) powers the
  majority of the world's computing infrastructure.  It is maintained by
  distributed communities, free to use, and has outcompeted proprietary
  alternatives in most domains.

### 5.4 Historical Evidence: Internet vs. Telecom

The internet and the telephone network are the cleanest natural experiment:

| Dimension | Telephone (Regulated) | Internet (Open) |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Structure | Monopoly (AT&T) for 70 years | No central authority |
| Innovation | Slow, centrally planned | Explosive, unpredictable |
| Access | Licensed, controlled | Permissionless |
| Cost | High (long distance calls) | Low → free (VoIP) |
| Economic impact | Concentrated wealth | Distributed opportunity |
| New industries | Few | Uncountable |

Both technologies transmit information.  The difference is regulatory
structure.  The regulated version produced a monopoly.  The open version
produced the largest expansion of economic opportunity in history.

AI is at the same fork today.  The technology is capable of either outcome.
The regulatory environment will determine which path we follow.

### 5.5 Guardrails vs. Barriers

This is not an argument against all regulation.  Some regulation is
sensible:
- Safety standards for medical AI (narrow, specific, outcome-based)
- Transparency requirements for AI in criminal justice
- Data privacy protections

The question is whether regulation is designed to:
- **Prevent genuine harm** (narrow, specific rules targeting real risks), or
- **Protect incumbents** under the guise of safety (broad, expensive
  compliance regimes that only large corporations can satisfy)

The former can coexist with distributed ownership.  The latter concentrates
it.  The test is simple: **does this regulation make it harder for a small
player to compete with a large one?**  If yes, it is a barrier, not a
guardrail — regardless of how it is labeled.

### 5.6 The Advocacy Conclusion

**Logical chain:**
1. CHIP is anchored to the value of human labor.
2. Labor value rises when workers have access to productivity-amplifying
   tools **at competitive prices** (Section 3).
3. AI tools naturally trend toward open and cheap (Section 5.1).
4. The primary threat to competitive pricing is regulatory capture that
   creates monopolies, not market dynamics (Section 5.2).
5. Therefore, a free and competitive market for AI tools is an economic
   prerequisite for labor value — and by extension, for CHIP's long-term
   viability.

This is not a political stance.  It is a logical consequence of CHIP's
own definition.  If CHIP measures the value of labor in a "free and
balanced market" (the canonical definition), then CHIP has a structural
interest in markets that are actually free — including the market for
AI tools.  A monopoly on AI tools is a distortion in exactly the same
sense as a tariff or a border — it prevents the free market from pricing
labor at its true value.

The advocacy position is: **AI technology and automation should remain
open and accessible at free-market prices, not controlled by a few
mega-corporations wielding government regulatory leverage to suppress
competition.**  The logical justification is that monopoly pricing of AI
tools depresses the very thing CHIP measures.

## 6. CHIP's Evolution: From Index to Market Price

*CHIP does not require the reference category of labor to exist forever.
It needs a tether, not a chain.*

### 6.1 Phase 1: The Measured Index (Present)

Today, CHIP is an **estimated index**.  We observe wages across countries,
apply a production function (Cobb-Douglas with distortion adjustment),
aggregate with GDP-weighting, and publish a number.  This requires:
- Observable unskilled wages in multiple countries
- Reliable data sources (ILOSTAT, PWT, FRED)
- A methodology that is replicable and transparent

The index approach works well for bootstrapping trust.  Users can verify
the methodology, reproduce the calculation, and assess whether the number
is reasonable.  But it has limitations:
- Data arrives with a 2–3 year lag
- Methodological choices (weighting, imputation) introduce judgment
- The published value is a model output, not a market reality

### 6.2 Phase 2: The Market-Discovered Price (Future)

As MyCHIPs matures and actual transactions occur in CHIP-denominated
units, a market price emerges naturally: **what are people willing to
pay in dollars for a CHIP, and vice versa?**

This transition mirrors how many indices evolve:
- CPI started as a carefully measured basket; now it coexists with
  market-implied inflation expectations (TIPS breakevens, inflation swaps)
- Gold was once valued by assay and weight; now its price is set by
  trading

The goal is to gradually wean the market off the "CHIP estimation" and
toward a **market measure**.  The index doesn't disappear — it becomes a
calibration reference, a way to check whether the market price is drifting
from economic reality.

**Crucially, this transition does not require that people actually work
for exactly 1 CHIP per hour.**  Everyone can earn multiples of CHIPs.
The abstract concept of "one hour of unskilled labor" persists as the
unit's definition, just as "one troy ounce of gold" persists even though
nobody weighs gold at the general store.  What changes is not the utility
of the unit but our method of determining its price.

### 6.3 The Tethered Market: Why CHIP Is Not Gold

Gold is **untethered**.  Its price floats freely because there is no
recurring transaction that forces the market back to any reference value.
You can hoard gold indefinitely.  Its price is driven by sentiment,
scarcity engineering, and central bank behavior.  It can bubble 5× and
crash 50% because nothing in the real economy forces reversion.

CHIP has a **delivery mechanism**: labor.  In any MyCHIPs network where
actual labor contracts are denominated in CHIPs, both parties know the
definition.  The laborer knows "one CHIP should be worth about an hour of
my unskilled time."  The buyer knows it too.

- If the market price of CHIP drifts **too high** relative to actual
  labor cost → the buyer switches to dollar-denominated contracts →
  selling pressure on CHIP → price falls back.
- If the market price drifts **too low** → the laborer says "this isn't
  worth my time at that rate" and refuses → CHIP-denominated labor becomes
  scarce → price rises back.

**You don't need all contracts to be labor-denominated.**  You just need
*some*.  Those labor-reference transactions act like the physical delivery
option in commodity futures: most futures contracts are settled in cash and
never delivered physically, but the *possibility* of delivery keeps the
futures price tethered to the spot price.  Similarly, most CHIP
transactions may be for goods, services, or debt settlement — but the
existence of labor-denominated contracts where both parties know the CHIP
definition keeps the whole market honest.

### 6.4 Resistance to Speculative Bubbles

CHIP has a structural defense against speculative manipulation that gold
and other commodities lack: **you cannot corner the labor market.**

- Gold can be hoarded.  A cartel can restrict supply and drive up prices.
- Labor is **perishable** — you cannot stockpile hours.  Today's unsold
  hour is gone tomorrow.
- Labor supply is the **entire global workforce** — billions of people,
  regenerating daily.
- Labor is **universally distributed** — everyone has it, everywhere, by
  default.

Nobody can buy up all the CHIPs and squeeze the market because any laborer
anywhere can issue new CHIPs by offering their time.  The supply is
inherently distributed and elastic.  Artificial scarcity — the prerequisite
for speculative bubbles — is structurally impossible.

### 6.5 The Index as Calibration Fallback

In Phase 2, the published CHIP index serves as a **sanity check**, not the
primary price signal:

- If the market CHIP price diverges significantly from the index value,
  it signals either (a) the market knows something the index doesn't, or
  (b) the market is mispricing.
- Market participants can use the index to calibrate their own judgment.
- The index provides continuity during disruptions (data outages, market
  panics).

Over time, the index becomes less important as the market deepens and
liquidity grows.  But it never becomes zero — it remains the definitional
anchor that gives CHIP its meaning and prevents it from drifting into pure
speculation.

## 7. Supporting Evidence and Possible Studies

*Empirical work that could strengthen the arguments above.  Some of this
data is already available from completed workbench studies; the rest
represents future research directions.*

### 7.1 Baumol Effect Quantification

**Question:** At what rate has the real price of labor-intensive services
risen relative to goods over the past 50 years?

**Approach:** Compute historical price trajectories for labor-intensive
services (haircuts, restaurant meals, childcare, home repair) vs.
capital-intensive goods (electronics, clothing, food staples), deflated to
CHIP-denominated prices.  The inflation-tracking study partially addressed
this.  A dedicated study could quantify the annual Baumol appreciation rate
across multiple countries and time periods.

**Why it matters:** If the Baumol effect has been 1–2% per year
historically, that provides a quantitative floor on CHIP's real
appreciation rate — even before considering AI-driven productivity gains.

### 7.2 Automation Exposure of CHIP's Reference Category

**Question:** What fraction of "elementary occupations" (ISCO-9 — the
CHIP reference category) are at high risk of full automation, and what
fraction are "human-presence" tasks that resist automation?

**Approach:** Cross-reference ILOSTAT occupational data with academic
automation-exposure scores (Frey & Osborne 2013, updated versions).
Classify ISCO-9 sub-categories as "automatable" (warehouse picking,
simple assembly) vs. "human-presence" (cleaning, caregiving, food
service).

**Why it matters:** Determines whether CHIP's reference basket is
predominantly in the "approaches zero" or "retains value" bucket under
the bifurcation scenario.  If the majority of elementary occupations are
human-presence tasks, the pessimistic narrative's relevance to CHIP is
significantly weakened.

### 7.3 Reservation Wage Estimation Across Countries

**Question:** Is there a measurable relationship between a country's
standard of living and its workers' reservation wages?

**Approach:** Use labor force participation rate vs. GDP per capita as a
proxy.  Countries with higher living standards should show lower
participation rates (people choosing not to work), which is the
reservation wage effect in aggregate.  PWT and ILOSTAT data are available
for this analysis.

**Why it matters:** Empirically validates the core mechanism of Section 3
— that prosperity raises the floor on labor value.  A strong correlation
would provide a functional form for predicting how AI-driven prosperity
affects global reservation wages.

### 7.4 Labor Share Trends

**Question:** Has labor's share of national income been rising or falling,
and does the pattern differ between developed and developing countries?

**Approach:** PWT includes labor share data (`labsh`).  Compute trends for
the 85 countries in our pipeline over 2000–2022.  Disaggregate by income
tier.

**Why it matters:** The declining-labor-share narrative (labor getting a
smaller slice of GDP since ~1980) is often cited as evidence for the
pessimistic case.  If it is primarily a developed-world phenomenon, or if
it correlates with regulatory concentration rather than technology per se,
the pessimistic narrative weakens.

### 7.5 Historical Automation Wave Analysis

**Question:** What happened to unskilled wages during previous automation
waves, and how long did the adjustment take?

**Approach:** Quantify the trajectory of unskilled real wages during the
agricultural mechanization (1800–1900), manufacturing automation
(1950–1980), and computerization (1990–2020).  Assess whether each wave
produced a temporary dip followed by a long-run rise, and what the
characteristic adjustment period was.

**Why it matters:** If every previous automation wave eventually raised
labor value after a transition period, the prior for the AI wave is
positive.  The length of past adjustment periods informs expectations for
how long the current transition might take.

## 8. Conclusions

### 8.1 Summary of the Argument

The chain of reasoning:

1. **AI amplifies labor productivity** — this is happening regardless of
   policy choices.
2. **If tools are accessible to workers**, each worker captures the
   productivity gain → meets needs with fewer hours → reservation wage
   rises → labor value increases.
3. **If tools are concentrated**, platform owners capture the gain →
   workers are excluded → must compete at whatever rate is offered →
   labor value falls.
4. **Technology naturally trends toward open and cheap** (Moore's Law,
   open source, commoditization).
5. **The primary mechanism of concentration is regulatory capture**, not
   market dynamics.
6. **Therefore**, the trajectory of labor value — and of CHIP — depends
   on whether AI remains open and accessible.

This is not utopian speculation.  Each link in the chain has historical
precedent and, where possible, empirical support from our own analysis.

### 8.2 The Case for Labor-Anchoring Despite Uncertainty

Even with uncertainty about the future, CHIP remains preferable to fiat
currency as a unit of account:

- **Fiat currency is subject to arbitrary manipulation**; labor value is
  not.  Central banks print money; no one prints labor.
- **Labor is universal.**  Every adult human has it.  It requires no
  government, no institution, no permission.
- **If labor value changes, it changes for real reasons** — technology,
  demographics, productivity — not political whim.
- **CHIP is honest.**  If labor value declines, CHIP reflects that
  honestly rather than hiding it behind nominal stability (as fiat does
  through inflation).

### 8.3 The Case for Open AI

CHIP has a structural interest in open technology — not as a political
preference, but as a logical consequence of its own definition:

- CHIP measures the value of labor "in a hypothetical worldwide, free,
  and balanced market where there are no borders, tariffs, or other
  distortions."
- Regulatory barriers that concentrate AI tools are **distortions** in
  exactly the sense the CHIP definition imagines away.
- Advocating for open AI is advocating for the market conditions under
  which CHIP's definition is most meaningful.

The advocacy position: **keep AI open, keep the market for AI tools
competitive, and labor value takes care of itself.**

### 8.4 Open Questions

- Can "unskilled labor" be defined in a way that is robust to automation?
  (Section 7.2 proposes a study to investigate.)
- At what point does the Phase 1 → Phase 2 transition occur?  What level
  of MyCHIPs adoption is needed for market price discovery to supersede
  the index?
- If CHIP's real value is rising over time (due to Baumol and
  productivity amplification), should CHIP be understood as an
  *appreciating* unit of account — and what are the implications for
  contracts denominated in CHIPs?
- How should MyCHIPs communicate the difference between the published
  index and the market price once both exist?
