# The Future of Labor Value in an Age of Automation

*This paper argues that AI and automation will raise — not lower — the real
value of human labor, provided that the underlying technology remains open
and accessible at competitive prices.  It presents a logical case for why
open access to AI is an economic prerequisite for labor value, and by
extension for the long-term viability of labor-anchored value systems like
CHIP.*

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Question

As AI and robotics increasingly perform tasks currently done by humans,
will the economic value of human labor increase or decrease?

This is not an academic question for CHIP.  CHIP is anchored to the value
of one hour of nominal unskilled labor.  If that value trends toward zero,
CHIP loses its grounding.  If it rises, CHIP becomes a more robust unit of
account.  The trajectory matters.

### 1.2 Why This Matters for CHIP

CHIP's long-term viability rests on two propositions.  First, that labor
has measurable economic value: if AI renders human work worthless, then
CHIP measures nothing.  Second, that this value is stable enough to anchor
a unit of account: wild swings would undermine CHIP's usefulness as a
reference.

This paper argues that both propositions hold — but only under specific
conditions regarding technology access.  The value of labor is not a fixed
physical constant; it is a function of what workers can produce, what
alternatives they have, and whether they can capture the gains from their
own productivity.  Each of these variables is shaped by who has access to
AI tools and at what price.

### 1.3 Scope and Thesis

This paper considers **market-based outcomes only**.  Government
redistribution schemes such as Universal Basic Income are not considered
as solutions, because they do not address the fundamental economic
question — they merely obscure it by ignoring the liability side of the
ledger.  Someone always pays.  The question is whether the economic value
of labor itself rises or falls, not whether transfer payments can mask the
answer.

**Thesis:** Like any other form of capital, AI and automation amplify human
labor productivity.  If the tools are universally accessible **at
free-market prices**, workers capture the productivity gain, work fewer
hours to meet their needs, and demand higher compensation for their
remaining time.  Labor value rises.  If the tools are concentrated in the
hands of a few — or available only at monopoly prices that extract the
surplus — workers are excluded from the gains and must compete for
remaining jobs at whatever rate the power structure dictates.  Labor value
falls.

The fork in the road is **competitive access**, not technology.  And the
primary threat to competitive access is regulatory capture that entrenches
incumbents, because the technology itself naturally trends toward open and
cheap.

## 2. The Pessimistic Narrative

Before arguing against the popular "robots take all the jobs" narrative, it
is important to present it fairly.  The pessimistic case is not frivolous.
It is based on a straightforward economic argument that deserves a serious
answer.

### 2.1 The Supply/Demand Argument

The pessimistic case is built on basic supply and demand.  If AI can
perform most tasks currently done by humans, then the demand for human
labor falls.  The supply of human labor, however, remains roughly constant
— people still exist, still need income, and still show up looking for
work.  When supply exceeds demand, prices drop.  Applied to the labor
market, this means wages fall as workers compete for a shrinking pool of
remaining jobs.  Taken to its logical extreme, human labor approaches zero
value.

This argument is simple, intuitive, and dominates popular media coverage of
AI.  It is also incomplete.

### 2.2 Historical Precedent

Every major wave of automation in the past two centuries has provoked the
same fear — and the same fear has been wrong every time.

The agricultural share of US employment fell from roughly 80% in 1800 to
under 2% in 2020.  Millions of farm workers were displaced by tractors,
harvesters, and industrial farming.  Yet these workers did not become
permanently unemployed.  They moved into manufacturing, then into
services.  Each transition took decades and caused real hardship during
the adjustment period, but the long-run outcome was unambiguous: overall
living standards rose and labor remained valuable, just in different
forms.

The pattern repeated with manufacturing automation in the mid-twentieth
century and with computerization at the turn of the twenty-first.  In
every case, new industries emerged to absorb displaced workers, and the
post-transition economy was richer than the pre-transition one.  At least,
this was the outcome in countries where markets were free enough to allow
the adjustment to occur.

### 2.3 Why AI Might Be Different

The strongest version of the pessimistic case acknowledges the historical
record but argues that AI represents a qualitative break.  Previous
automation technologies were **domain-specific**: tractors only farm, looms
only weave, calculators only compute.  Workers displaced from one domain
could flee to another.

AI is **general-purpose**.  It can potentially perform any cognitive task —
writing, analyzing, diagnosing, designing, translating, coding — across
every sector simultaneously.  If this capability matures fully, there may
be no domain left for displaced workers to flee to.  The escape routes that
existed in previous transitions may not exist this time.

This is a serious argument.  It deserves a serious answer.

### 2.4 Where the Narrative Goes Wrong

A more useful framing: AI is not different in *kind* from previous
automation waves.  It is different in *depth*.

Each wave of technology has displaced a tier of the labor hierarchy and
pushed workers upward into a new tier that did not previously exist:

| Wave | Displaced | Workers moved to |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Agricultural mechanization (1800s) | Farm labor | Factory floors — "blue collar" |
| Industrial automation (1900s) | Repetitive manufacturing | Offices, services — "white collar" |
| Computerization (1980s–2000s) | Clerical, data processing | Knowledge work, creative roles |
| AI (2020s–) | Routine cognitive tasks | ??? |

The pattern is consistent: technology automates the bottom of the current
hierarchy, and people move up.  The pessimistic claim is that AI breaks
this pattern because there is no "up" left — it automates everything.

But each previous wave also appeared to leave no room above.  Factory
workers in 1890 could not imagine "white collar" jobs — the category
barely existed.  Clerical workers in 1980 could not imagine "data
scientist" or "UX designer" as careers.  The next tier of work is, almost
by definition, invisible from the current one.  It emerges only after the
transition creates the conditions for it.

We might call the emerging tier **"no-collar"** — not in the sense of
unemployment, but in the sense that work becomes so integrated with
personal agency, creativity, and human connection that the traditional
distinction between "work" and "life" blurs.  Some of this is already
visible: people who earn a living through creative expression, community
building, caregiving, mentorship, or curating experiences.  These
activities were not "jobs" a generation ago.  They are becoming jobs now —
and AI amplification accelerates the trend.

Beyond upward displacement, the pessimistic narrative ignores two
additional forces.  First, **productivity amplification**: AI does not just
replace workers; it makes remaining workers vastly more productive.  A
farmer with a tractor does not compete with the tractor.  The farmer
*uses* the tractor to produce a hundred times more than a farmer with a
hoe.  Second, **the reservation wage**: the supply/demand argument assumes
workers will accept any wage, however low.  In practice, workers with
alternatives — savings, leisure, other opportunities — have a floor below
which they refuse to sell their time.  If productivity gains raise living
standards, that floor rises.

Both forces are developed in detail in the following section.

The pessimistic narrative correctly identifies that demand for unaugmented
human labor at current skill tiers may fall.  But it incorrectly concludes
that the value of *human time* falls.  These are different things.

---

## 3. The Productivity-Amplification Argument

The core positive case is this: AI amplifies labor rather than replacing
it.  Each hour of human effort becomes more productive when paired with
intelligent tools.  But this only raises labor value if the worker has
access to the tools — a condition that is not guaranteed, and whose
fulfillment depends on the market structure analyzed in Section 4.

### 3.1 Tools Amplify Labor; They Don't Replace It

Every major technological advance in history has amplified human labor
productivity.  The plow allowed one farmer to feed dozens instead of one
family.  The printing press allowed one author to reach millions instead
of dozens.  The automobile allowed one driver to cover five hundred miles
instead of thirty.  The computer allowed one analyst to process millions
of records instead of hundreds.

In each case, the tool did not make the human irrelevant.  It made each
hour of human effort vastly more productive.  The human *with* the tool
outcompetes the human *without* it — but both remain economically active
as long as there is work to be done, and there is always work to be done
because human wants are unlimited.

The AI parallel is already visible.  A cleaner with AI-managed logistics
serves ten clients per day instead of three.  An electrician with AI
diagnostics completes jobs in half the time.  A small farmer with
AI-optimized planting yields three times more per acre.  In each case, the
worker earns more per hour, not less.

The key condition is that **the worker must have access to the tool at
competitive prices**.  A farmer with no tractor is worse off when
competitors have tractors.  A farmer who must rent a tractor at a price
that absorbs all the productivity gain is no better off — they have
"access" in name but capture none of the surplus.  The technology itself is
neither good nor bad for labor.  What matters is whether the worker can
obtain it at free-market prices that reflect actual cost, not monopoly
rents.

### 3.2 The Reservation Wage Mechanism

The minimum wage someone will accept — their **reservation wage** —
depends on their alternative.  When the alternative to work is poverty,
workers accept subsistence wages.  When the alternative is comfortable
leisure, because basic needs can be met through a modest amount of
AI-amplified work, workers demand more.

The mechanism applied to AI proceeds in four steps.  First, AI amplifies
productivity, so workers can meet their basic needs with fewer hours of
work.  Second, with needs met, remaining hours become leisure.  Third, to
draw a worker away from leisure, an employer must offer something
genuinely compelling.  Fourth, wages per hour rise — even as total hours
worked may fall.

The total income may or may not change.  But the *per-hour value of labor*
increases.  And the per-hour value is precisely what CHIP measures.

### 3.3 The Back Massage Thought Experiment

Consider two scenarios that illustrate the reservation wage mechanism
concretely.

In **Scenario A**, the worker is hungry.  They have not eaten today and
need money to buy dinner.  They will give you a back massage for whatever
you are willing to pay, because the alternative — going hungry — is worse
than any wage.

In **Scenario B**, the worker's needs are met.  They spent a few hours
this morning on AI-amplified work that covered their expenses for the
week.  They are now enjoying their afternoon — reading, gardening, spending
time with family.  You want a back massage.  You must offer something
genuinely compelling to draw them away from their leisure.

In Scenario B, the same hour of labor costs *more*, not less.

The worker in Scenario B is not idle or dependent.  They work — but only a
little, because each hour of their AI-amplified labor is so productive
that a few hours per week suffice.  The rest of their time is theirs.
This is the contrarian outcome: abundance makes labor scarce, and
scarcity makes it valuable.

### 3.4 Cross-Country Evidence Today

The reservation wage effect need not be treated as speculation.  It is
observable across countries right now.

American workers command higher wages than workers in developing countries
performing equivalent tasks.  Why?  Not solely because of productivity
differences — though those matter.  A significant factor is that American
workers have *alternatives*: a higher baseline standard of living, more
leisure options, and a greater opportunity cost of working.  A worker who
could be earning $25/hour doing something else will not accept $5/hour
for unskilled labor.

The CHIP weighting study (see `docs/weighting-analysis.md`) quantified
this effect.  Country-level multipliers range from 0.04× (Egypt) to 2.39×
(Switzerland).  Workers in prosperous countries are valued at ten to sixty
times more per hour than workers in poor countries doing comparable tasks.
Productivity differences explain part of this gap, but not all — the
CHIP pipeline's distortion factor (θ) already adjusts for productivity.
The residual reflects reservation wages, institutional quality, and
bargaining power, all of which correlate with prosperity.

The implication is direct.  In countries where abundance already exists
relative to the global baseline, labor costs more.  If automation raises
global living standards toward what wealthy countries enjoy today, we would
expect reservation wages to rise globally, the floor of acceptable
compensation to increase, and human time to become more precious — not
less.

### 3.5 Baumol's Cost Disease: The Historical Trend

William Baumol observed in 1966 that labor-intensive services resist
productivity gains.  A string quartet still requires four musicians playing
for thirty minutes.  A haircut still takes thirty minutes.  Caregiving,
teaching, massage, and artisanal craft are structurally labor-intensive —
and no amount of technology changes that.

As technology drives down the cost of manufactured goods, these
labor-intensive services become *relatively more expensive*.  Economists
usually discuss this as a problem ("cost disease").  But from the
perspective of labor value, it is a feature: the real price of human time
rises relative to goods.

The CHIP inflation-tracking study (see `docs/inflation-tracking.md`)
confirmed this pattern empirically.  When prices are denominated in CHIPs
— that is, measured in hours of unskilled labor — manufactured goods
become cheaper over time while personal services hold steady or rise.
This is Baumol's effect in action, and it represents a long-run tailwind
for labor value.

The implication for CHIP is significant.  Even if AI automates commodity
production entirely, it cannot automate the *human presence* component of
labor-intensive services.  A robot massage may be technically competent,
but consumers demonstrably pay a premium for human touch.  "Handmade" and
"artisanal" command higher prices than machine-made, even when the
products are objectively similar.  As commodity prices fall toward zero and
service prices hold, the share of economic activity represented by human
labor rises in real terms.

## 4. The Access Fork

The productivity-amplification argument (Section 3) established that AI
tools can raise the value of labor.  But that argument carries a critical
condition: the worker must have access to the tools at competitive prices.
This section develops the condition into the paper's central thesis: the
same technology produces opposite outcomes depending on who controls it.

### 4.1 Same Technology, Two Opposite Outcomes

AI is not inherently good or bad for labor.  It is an amplifier.  The
question is: whose labor does it amplify?

If everyone has access to AI tools at competitive prices, each worker
becomes vastly more productive and captures the gain.  Abundance follows.
Reservation wages rise.  Labor value increases.

If access is denied or priced at monopoly rates, the tool owners capture
all the productivity gains.  Everyone else must compete for whatever work
the owners deign to offer, at whatever terms the owners dictate.  Wages
fall.  Labor value decreases.

It is important to recognize that "access at monopoly prices" is
economically equivalent to no access at all.  If a platform charges 90%
of the surplus for use of its AI tools, the worker is technically "using"
the tool but capturing almost none of the benefit.  The test is not
whether workers *can* use AI, but whether they can use it at prices set
by competition — where multiple providers compete and margins reflect
actual costs, not market power.

This is not a spectrum.  It is a fork — a structural question whose answer
determines the direction of labor value.

### 4.2 Path A: Distributed Access — Labor Value Rises

When AI tools are universally accessible at competitive prices — in the
way that smartphones, the internet, and hand tools are accessible today —
five consequences follow.

First, **workers amplify their own productivity**.  A self-employed
tradesperson uses AI scheduling, diagnostics, and logistics to serve more
clients per day, and keeps the gains because the tools cost a fraction of
the surplus they generate.

Second, **small businesses compete with large ones**.  The cost advantage
of scale shrinks when the tools are free or cheap.  A solo contractor with
a $50/month AI suite can compete with a corporation's $50 million
platform.

Third, **workers bargain from strength**.  With their own productive
capacity, they do not need to accept exploitative terms from any single
employer or platform.

Fourth, **reservation wages rise**.  Workers who can meet their needs in
twenty hours per week will not sell the other twenty cheaply.

Fifth, **new forms of work emerge**.  History shows that when tools are
distributed at low cost, people invent uses no one anticipated.  The
internet produced entire careers — social media manager, app developer,
e-commerce entrepreneur — that did not exist in 1990.

These consequences, taken together, break what might be called the
**dependency chain**.  Today, most workers operate within a linear
dependency:

> I need to eat → I must buy food → I need money → I must work for an
> employer on their terms.

Every link forces the worker toward the next, and the chain terminates at
"accept whatever a large entity offers."  The worker has no exit, so they
have no leverage.  Labor is priced by desperation, not negotiation.

Notice that the chain embeds three centralized dependencies, each of which
has historically been controlled by large institutions:

- **Centralized supply chain** — "I must buy food" assumes the worker
  depends on a global distribution system to meet basic needs.
- **Centralized money** — "I need money" assumes a fiat currency system
  controlled by central banks and intermediated by commercial banks.
- **Centralized employment** — "I must work for an employer" assumes the
  traditional job: selling labor to a large entity on the entity's terms.

Each of these dependencies is now breakable.  AI and automation can help
individuals manage much of their own supply chain — growing food,
generating energy, fabricating goods — at scales that were previously
impossible without industrial infrastructure.  A peer-to-peer credit
network like [MyCHIPs](https://mychips.org) allows people to, in essence,
create their own money: extending credit directly to each other,
denominated in a labor-anchored unit, without routing through a central
bank.  And distributed digital networks allow people to create their own
work: offering services directly to peers, finding customers without a
corporate intermediary, building livelihoods that no employer designed.

When all three dependencies break simultaneously, the chain does not merely
loosen — it dissolves into a **network** with multiple paths.  The worker
no longer depends on any single employer, any single currency, or any
single supply chain.  They can walk away from a bad deal because they have
other options at every link.

This is the reservation wage argument made structural.  The reservation
wage is not just "I have savings so I can hold out for a better offer."
It is "I have independent productive capacity, my own medium of exchange,
and direct access to the things I need — so I don't *need* your offer."
That is a fundamentally different bargaining position, and it is only
possible when the tools of production are accessible at competitive prices.

This distributed, multi-path economic model is not hypothetical.  It is
the founding premise of both [MyCHIPs](https://mychips.org) and
[GotChoices](https://gotchoices.org).  A peer-to-peer credit network
where individuals extend value directly to each other, denominated in a
labor-anchored unit of account, *is* the infrastructure for an economy
that does not route through centralized gatekeepers.  CHIP as a unit of
account, MyCHIPs as a network, and open AI as a productivity amplifier are
three pieces of the same vision: an economy where individuals transact
freely, produce independently, and bargain from strength.

Seen from this angle, the AI revolution is not the beginning of the end.
It is, potentially, the dawn of an age in which human labor is more
valuable, more voluntary, and more dignified than at any point in history —
provided the tools remain open.

In this path, the CHIP value rises because the same hour of human time
commands a higher price.  The worker owns their own labor and can obtain
the tools that amplify it at prices set by open competition.

### 4.3 Path B: Concentrated Access — Labor Value Falls

When AI tools are controlled by a small number of entities — whether
through outright exclusion or through monopoly pricing that extracts the
surplus — the consequences reverse.

First, **workers are excluded from productivity gains**.  The technology
exists, but the worker either cannot use it or cannot afford it at prices
that leave any margin.

Second, **platform monopolies extract surplus**.  A gig worker whose AI
logistics are controlled by a platform must accept the platform's terms.
The platform captures 80% of the productivity gain; the worker gets 20%
or less.  The worker has "access" in the nominal sense but derives no
meaningful benefit.

Third, **workers compete for access**.  Instead of owning tools, workers
bid for the right to use them, driving their own compensation down in the
process.

Fourth, **extractive dynamics persist**.  The power structure dictates
terms.  The many must do whatever the few allow, at whatever rate the few
offer.  This is the modern equivalent of sharecropping: the worker does the
labor, the platform owns the tools, and the split is whatever the platform
decides.

Fifth, **reservation wages stagnate or fall**.  Without independent
productive capacity at affordable cost, workers have no leverage.  The
alternative to bad work is no work, and no work means poverty.

In this path, the CHIP value falls because workers cannot bargain for their
time.  They own their labor but lack affordable access to the tools that
make it valuable.

### 4.4 The Hinge Variable Is Access, Not Technology

The technology is the same in both paths.  AI capabilities advance
regardless.  The question is purely structural: can workers obtain the
tools at prices set by free-market competition?

This reframes the entire "AI and jobs" debate.  The right question is not
"will AI take jobs?" — it is "will workers have access to AI at
competitive prices?"  Nominal access behind a monopoly paywall is not
access.  The test is whether the market for AI tools is itself free and
competitive: multiple providers, low switching costs, open standards, no
artificial barriers to entry.  If yes, labor value rises.  If no, labor
value falls.  Everything else is secondary.

---

## 5. Why Concentration Happens: The Regulatory Paradox

Section 4 established that the trajectory of labor value depends on
whether AI tools are available at competitive prices.  A natural follow-up
question: why wouldn't they be?  If the technology is powerful and
valuable, why wouldn't a free market distribute it widely?

The answer is that a truly free market *would* distribute it widely.  The
natural trajectory of technology is toward open and cheap.  The primary
force that prevents this distribution is not market dynamics but
**regulatory capture** — the use of government power to create barriers
that entrench incumbents and suppress competition.

### 5.1 Technology Naturally Trends Toward Open and Cheap

Left to market forces alone, technology distributes.  Moore's Law has
halved the price of computing power roughly every eighteen months for five
decades.  Supercomputer capacity from 2010 fits in a $1,000 laptop in
2025.  Open-source AI models — LLaMA, Mistral, Stable Diffusion, and
their successors — deliver state-of-the-art capability to anyone with
consumer hardware.  What was cutting-edge proprietary technology becomes
commodity within five to ten years.  Cloud computing, smartphones, and GPS
all followed this arc.

**The cost floor is visible.**  In a competitive market, the price of AI
access converges to three components:

1. **Amortized cost of hardware** — chips, servers, and devices that
   follow well-known cost curves (Moore's Law for semiconductors, Wright's
   Law for manufacturing scale).
2. **Cost of energy** — electricity to run the hardware, itself a
   commodity traded on open markets.
3. **Competitive return on capital** — the profit margin required to
   attract investment into AI infrastructure.  In competitive commodity
   markets with low to moderate risk, this is typically in the range of
   3–7%: enough to justify the investment, not enough to extract rents.

There is no secret ingredient, no scarce raw material, no irreplaceable
human genius in the marginal cost of running an AI model.  Training a
frontier model is expensive today — tens or hundreds of millions of
dollars — but *inference*, the act of actually using the model, costs a
fraction of a cent per query and falling.  Once a model is trained,
serving it requires hardware, electricity, and a normal business margin.
Nothing more.

The "natural" price of AI access, in a competitive market, is therefore
low and declining.  The third term — return on capital — is important to
acknowledge explicitly.  No one is arguing that AI providers should operate
at cost.  Profit is the incentive that builds data centers and improves
models.  But in a competitive market, that profit is modest — single-digit
percentages, kept in check by competitors who will undercut any provider
charging significantly more than the actual cost of service.

If a provider is charging ten or a hundred times the
hardware-plus-energy-plus-margin cost, the excess is not "the cost of AI."
It is a monopoly rent.  The distinction matters because monopoly rents can
be sustained indefinitely through market power, whereas competitive margins
cannot grow because rivals enter and undercut.

The natural trajectory of AI is toward universal access at commodity
prices.  Government does not need to distribute it.  Government needs only
to *not block* distribution — and not to create the market power that
enables monopoly pricing.

### 5.2 Heavy Regulation Favors Concentration

A counterintuitive dynamic emerges when well-intentioned regulation
encounters concentrated industries: regulation intended to "protect"
workers or "ensure safety" often achieves the opposite.

Compliance costs create barriers to entry.  Lawyers, auditors, safety
certifications, and licensing fees cost millions of dollars.  Only
well-resourced incumbents can afford them.  A startup with a better AI
tool cannot compete if deploying it requires a two-year, ten-million-dollar
regulatory approval process.  The startup dies; the incumbent survives —
not because its product is better, but because it can absorb the
compliance costs.

Large corporations understand this dynamic and exploit it.  They actively
lobby for complex regulation *because* they can afford compliance and their
competitors cannot.  This is **regulatory capture** — the use of government
machinery to entrench market position under the guise of public interest.
The economist George Stigler formalized this observation in 1971, and it
has been confirmed in industry after industry since.

The historical record is clear:

- **Telecom:** Heavy regulation produced Ma Bell — a single monopoly
  controlling all telephone service in the United States for seventy
  years.  Deregulation in the 1980s produced competition, lower prices,
  and an explosion of innovation.
- **Banking:** Post-2008 regulation produced "too big to fail" — a small
  number of mega-banks that are effectively government-guaranteed.  Small
  community banks disappeared by the thousands.
- **Pharmaceuticals:** FDA approval costs average $2.6 billion per drug.
  Only large pharmaceutical companies can absorb these costs.  Generic
  manufacturers are delayed by years through regulatory and legal
  maneuvering.

In each case, regulation was introduced with benign intent — consumer
protection, financial stability, public health.  In each case, the primary
beneficiary was the incumbent.

### 5.3 Historical Evidence: Open vs. Regulated

When technology is freely available, competitive advantage shifts from
*owning* the tools to *applying* them creatively.  Low barriers to entry
enable many small players.  Innovation accelerates because experimentation
is cheap and failure is affordable.

The internet and the telephone network provide the cleanest natural
experiment in economic history.  Both technologies transmit information.
The difference is regulatory structure.

| Dimension | Telephone (Regulated) | Internet (Open) |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Structure | Monopoly (AT&T) for 70 years | No central authority |
| Innovation | Slow, centrally planned | Explosive, unpredictable |
| Access | Licensed, controlled | Permissionless |
| Cost | High (long distance calls) | Low → free (VoIP) |
| Economic impact | Concentrated wealth | Distributed opportunity |
| New industries | Few | Uncountable |

The regulated version produced a monopoly.  The open version produced the
largest expansion of economic opportunity in human history.

Open-source software tells the same story.  Linux, Apache, Python, and
TensorFlow power the majority of the world's computing infrastructure.
They are maintained by distributed communities, free to use, and have
outcompeted proprietary alternatives in most domains — not because they
were subsidized, but because open competition drives quality up and costs
down.

AI is at the same fork today.  The technology is capable of either outcome.
The regulatory environment will determine which path we follow.

### 5.4 Guardrails vs. Barriers

This is not an argument against all regulation.  Some regulation is both
sensible and necessary: safety standards for medical AI, transparency
requirements for AI used in criminal justice, data privacy protections.
These are narrow rules targeting specific, identifiable harms.

The question is whether regulation is designed to **prevent genuine harm**
— through narrow, specific rules targeting real risks — or to **protect
incumbents** under the guise of safety, through broad and expensive
compliance regimes that only large corporations can satisfy.

The former can coexist with distributed access.  The latter concentrates
it.  The test is simple: does this regulation make it harder for a small
player to compete with a large one?  If yes, it is a barrier, not a
guardrail — regardless of how it is labeled.

### 5.5 The Advocacy Conclusion

The logical chain is now complete:

1. CHIP is anchored to the value of human labor.
2. Labor value rises when workers have access to productivity-amplifying
   tools at competitive prices.
3. AI tools naturally trend toward open and cheap.
4. The primary threat to competitive pricing is regulatory capture that
   creates monopolies, not market dynamics.
5. Therefore, a free and competitive market for AI tools is an economic
   prerequisite for labor value — and by extension, for CHIP's long-term
   viability.

This is not a political stance.  It is a logical consequence of CHIP's own
definition.  If CHIP measures the value of labor in a "free and balanced
market" (the canonical definition from
[gotchoices.org](https://gotchoices.org/mychips/definition.html)), then
CHIP has a structural interest in markets that are actually free —
including the market for AI tools.  A monopoly on AI tools is a distortion
in exactly the same sense as a tariff or a border: it prevents the free
market from pricing labor at its true value.

The advocacy position follows directly: **AI technology and automation
should remain open and accessible at free-market prices, not controlled by
a few mega-corporations wielding government regulatory leverage to suppress
competition.**  The logical justification is that monopoly pricing of AI
tools depresses the very thing CHIP measures.

## 6. CHIP's Evolution: From Index to Market Price

The argument so far has addressed the trajectory of labor value under AI.
But a natural objection remains: what if the specific category of labor
that CHIP measures — unskilled, elementary occupations — changes so
fundamentally that it can no longer be observed?  What if "unskilled jobs"
simply disappear?

The answer is that CHIP does not require the reference category of labor to
exist in its current form forever.  It needs a tether, not a chain.

### 6.1 Phase 1: The Measured Index (Present)

Today, CHIP is an **estimated index**.  We observe wages across countries,
apply a production function (Cobb-Douglas with a distortion adjustment),
aggregate using GDP-weighting, and publish a number.  This requires
observable unskilled wages in multiple countries, reliable data sources
such as ILOSTAT, the Penn World Tables, and FRED, and a methodology that
is replicable and transparent.

The index approach works well for bootstrapping trust.  Users can verify
the methodology, reproduce the calculation, and assess whether the number
is reasonable.  But it has inherent limitations: source data arrives with
a two-to-three-year lag, methodological choices regarding weighting and
imputation introduce judgment, and the published value is ultimately a
model output — not a market reality.

### 6.2 Phase 2: The Market-Discovered Price (Future)

As MyCHIPs matures and actual transactions occur in CHIP-denominated
units, a market price will emerge naturally: what are people willing to pay
in dollars for a CHIP, and vice versa?

This transition mirrors how many indices evolve.  CPI started as a
carefully measured basket of goods; it now coexists with market-implied
inflation expectations derived from TIPS breakevens and inflation swaps.
Gold was once valued by assay and weight; its price is now set by trading
on commodity exchanges.

The goal is to gradually wean the market off the CHIP estimation and toward
a **market measure**.  The index does not disappear — it becomes a
calibration reference, a way to check whether the market price is drifting
from economic reality.

Crucially, this transition does not require that people actually work for
exactly one CHIP per hour.  Everyone can earn multiples of CHIPs.  The
abstract concept of "one hour of unskilled labor" persists as the unit's
definition, just as "one troy ounce of gold" persists as a unit even
though nobody weighs gold at the general store.  What changes is not the
utility of the unit but the method of determining its price.

This is the economy in which "no-collar" work (Section 2.4) flourishes.
When people trade directly in a labor-anchored unit, through a
peer-to-peer network, denominated in a currency whose definition they
understand, the dependency chain dissolves.  The CHIP itself becomes part
of the distributed infrastructure that makes labor valuable.

### 6.3 The Tethered Market: Why CHIP Is Not Gold

Gold is **untethered**.  Its price floats freely because there is no
recurring transaction that forces the market back to any reference value.
Gold can be hoarded indefinitely.  Its price is driven by sentiment,
scarcity engineering, and central bank behavior.  It can bubble five-fold
and crash 50% because nothing in the real economy compels reversion.

CHIP has a **delivery mechanism**: labor.  In any MyCHIPs network where
actual labor contracts are denominated in CHIPs, both parties know the
definition.  The laborer knows that one CHIP should be worth roughly one
hour of unskilled time.  The buyer knows it too.

If the market price of a CHIP drifts too high relative to the actual cost
of hiring someone for an hour, the buyer will switch to dollar-denominated
contracts.  This creates selling pressure on CHIPs and the price falls
back.  If the market price drifts too low, the laborer will refuse —
"that's not worth my time at that rate" — and CHIP-denominated labor
becomes scarce, pushing the price back up.

Not all contracts need to be labor-denominated for this mechanism to work.
Only *some* need to be.  Those labor-reference transactions act like the
physical delivery option in commodity futures: most futures contracts are
settled in cash and never delivered physically, but the *possibility* of
delivery keeps the futures price tethered to the spot price.  Similarly,
most CHIP transactions may involve goods, services, or debt settlement —
but the existence of labor-denominated contracts where both parties know
the CHIP definition keeps the entire market honest.

### 6.4 Resistance to Speculative Bubbles

CHIP has a structural defense against speculative manipulation that gold
and other commodities lack: you cannot corner the labor market.

Gold can be hoarded.  A cartel can restrict supply and drive up prices.
But labor is **perishable** — you cannot stockpile hours; today's unsold
hour is gone tomorrow.  Labor supply is the **entire global workforce** —
billions of people, regenerating daily.  And labor is **universally
distributed**: everyone has it, everywhere, by default.

Nobody can buy up all the CHIPs and squeeze the market, because any
laborer anywhere can issue new CHIPs by offering their time.  The supply
is inherently distributed and elastic.  Artificial scarcity — the
prerequisite for speculative bubbles — is structurally impossible when the
underlying commodity is human time.

### 6.5 The Index as Calibration Fallback

In Phase 2, the published CHIP index serves as a **sanity check**, not the
primary price signal.  If the market CHIP price diverges significantly from
the index value, it signals either that the market knows something the
index does not, or that the market is mispricing.  Market participants can
use the index to calibrate their own judgment.  The index also provides
continuity during disruptions such as data outages or market panics.

Over time, the index becomes less important as the market deepens and
liquidity grows.  But it never reaches zero relevance.  It remains the
definitional anchor that gives CHIP its meaning and prevents it from
drifting into pure speculation.

## 7. Supporting Evidence and Possible Studies

The arguments in Sections 2 through 6 are grounded in economic reasoning
and historical precedent.  Several of them can be further strengthened with
empirical work.  Some of this data is already available from completed
workbench studies; the rest represents future research directions.

### 7.1 Baumol Effect Quantification

**Question:** At what rate has the real price of labor-intensive services
risen relative to goods over the past fifty years?

**Approach:** Compute historical price trajectories for labor-intensive
services (haircuts, restaurant meals, childcare, home repair) and compare
them to capital-intensive goods (electronics, clothing, food staples),
deflated to CHIP-denominated prices.  The inflation-tracking study
partially addressed this.  A dedicated analysis could quantify the annual
Baumol appreciation rate across multiple countries and time periods.

**Why it matters:** If the Baumol effect has historically been 1–2% per
year, that provides a quantitative floor on CHIP's real appreciation rate —
even before considering AI-driven productivity gains.

### 7.2 Automation Exposure of CHIP's Reference Category

**Question:** What fraction of "elementary occupations" (ISCO-9, the CHIP
reference category) are at high risk of full automation, and what fraction
are "human-presence" tasks that resist automation?

**Approach:** Cross-reference ILOSTAT occupational data with academic
automation-exposure scores (Frey & Osborne 2013, and updated versions).
Classify ISCO-9 sub-categories as "automatable" (warehouse picking, simple
assembly) versus "human-presence" (cleaning, caregiving, food service).

**Why it matters:** This determines whether CHIP's reference basket falls
predominantly in the "approaches zero" or "retains value" bucket under
the bifurcation scenario.  If the majority of elementary occupations are
human-presence tasks, the pessimistic narrative's relevance to CHIP is
significantly weakened.

### 7.3 Reservation Wage Estimation Across Countries

**Question:** Is there a measurable relationship between a country's
standard of living and its workers' reservation wages?

**Approach:** Use labor force participation rate versus GDP per capita as a
proxy.  Countries with higher living standards should show lower
participation rates (people choosing not to work), which is the reservation
wage effect in aggregate.  PWT and ILOSTAT data are available for this
analysis.

**Why it matters:** This would empirically validate the core mechanism of
Section 3 — that prosperity raises the floor on labor value.  A strong
correlation would provide a functional form for predicting how AI-driven
prosperity affects global reservation wages.

### 7.4 Labor Share Trends

**Question:** Has labor's share of national income been rising or falling,
and does the pattern differ between developed and developing countries?

**Approach:** PWT includes labor share data (`labsh`).  Compute trends for
the 85 countries in our pipeline over 2000–2022, disaggregated by income
tier.

**Why it matters:** The declining-labor-share narrative — the observation
that labor receives a smaller slice of GDP since roughly 1980 — is often
cited as evidence for the pessimistic case.  If the decline is primarily a
developed-world phenomenon, or if it correlates with regulatory
concentration rather than technology per se, the pessimistic narrative
weakens and the regulatory-capture argument strengthens.

### 7.5 Historical Automation Wave Analysis

**Question:** What happened to unskilled wages during previous automation
waves, and how long did the adjustment take?

**Approach:** Quantify the trajectory of unskilled real wages during
agricultural mechanization (1800–1900), manufacturing automation
(1950–1980), and computerization (1990–2020).  Assess whether each wave
produced a temporary dip followed by a long-run rise, and estimate the
characteristic adjustment period.

**Why it matters:** If every previous automation wave eventually raised
labor value after a transition period, the historical prior for the AI wave
is positive.  The length of past adjustment periods informs expectations
for how long the current transition might take.

## 8. Conclusions

### 8.1 Summary of the Argument

This paper makes three claims.

First, **labor value rises under distributed access**.  AI amplifies
productivity.  If workers can obtain the tools at competitive prices, they
capture the gains, work fewer hours to meet their needs, and demand more
for their remaining time.  The reservation wage rises.  Baumol's cost
disease provides a long-run structural tailwind.  The historical pattern of
upward displacement — from blue collar to white collar to what we have
called "no-collar" — suggests that new categories of valuable human work
will emerge, as they always have.

Second, **the primary threat to labor value is regulatory concentration,
not technology**.  AI naturally trends toward open and cheap.  The cost
floor — hardware, energy, and a competitive return on capital — is low and
declining.  The only force that sustainably concentrates AI tools is
regulatory capture: barriers to entry that entrench incumbents and enable
monopoly pricing far above the competitive cost floor.

Third, **CHIP survives the transition regardless of which path unfolds**.
Even if the reference category of labor changes fundamentally, CHIP evolves
from a measured index to a market-discovered price, tethered to real labor
transactions through the definitional awareness of market participants, and
structurally resistant to speculation because labor supply cannot be
cornered.

Each claim rests on historical precedent and, where possible, empirical
support from our own analysis.  Section 7 proposes further studies to
strengthen the evidence base.

### 8.2 The Case for Labor-Anchoring Despite Uncertainty

Even with genuine uncertainty about the future, CHIP remains preferable to
fiat currency as a unit of account.

Fiat currency is subject to arbitrary manipulation.  Central banks print
money; no one prints labor.  Labor is universal — every adult human has it,
and it requires no government, no institution, no permission.  If labor
value changes, it changes for real reasons: technology, demographics,
productivity.  It does not change because a committee decided to change it.

And CHIP is honest.  If labor value declines, CHIP reflects that decline
transparently, rather than hiding it behind nominal stability the way fiat
currencies mask inflation.  Honesty is not always comfortable, but it is
the foundation of trust — and trust is the foundation of any unit of
account.

### 8.3 The Case for Open AI

CHIP has a structural interest in open technology — not as a political
preference, but as a logical consequence of its own definition.

CHIP measures the value of labor "in a hypothetical worldwide, free, and
balanced market where there are no borders, tariffs, or other
distortions."  Regulatory barriers that concentrate AI tools are
distortions in exactly the sense the CHIP definition imagines away.
Advocating for open AI is advocating for the market conditions under which
CHIP's definition is most meaningful.

The advocacy position is straightforward: **keep AI open, keep the market
for AI tools competitive, and labor value takes care of itself.**

### 8.4 Open Questions

Several questions remain open and would benefit from further investigation:

- Can "unskilled labor" be defined in a way that is robust to automation?
  Section 7.2 proposes a study to investigate the automation exposure of
  CHIP's reference category.
- At what point does the Phase 1 → Phase 2 transition occur?  What level
  of MyCHIPs adoption is needed for market price discovery to supersede the
  estimated index?
- If CHIP's real value is rising over time — due to Baumol's effect,
  productivity amplification, and rising reservation wages — should CHIP be
  understood as an *appreciating* unit of account, and what are the
  implications for long-term contracts denominated in CHIPs?
- How should MyCHIPs communicate the difference between the published index
  and the market price once both exist?

These questions do not undermine the paper's thesis.  They are refinements
— details to be worked out as the system matures and as the empirical
evidence develops.
