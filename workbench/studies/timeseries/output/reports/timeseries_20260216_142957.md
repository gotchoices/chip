## Key Finding: Deflation Cancels in CHIP Formula

CHIP = elementary_wage x (MPL / average_wage). Since deflation scales both
wages equally, the deflator cancels out. CHIP is the same whether you deflate
or not. To create a meaningful nominal series, we RE-INFLATE the constant-dollar
CHIP by the GDP deflator: `CHIP_nominal(Y) = CHIP_constant(Y) x deflator(Y)/100`.

## Plots

Saved to `output/plots/`:

- `timeseries_4panel.png`
- `nominal_vs_deflator.png`
- `country_count.png`
- `constant_vs_nominal.png`

---

## Preliminary Observations

- Nominal CHIP changed **+94.6%** from early to late period
- Constant CHIP changed **+41.2%** from early to late period
- **Supports H1**: Nominal CHIP rises faster than constant, consistent with inflation tracking

- Stable panel is **17% more volatile** than full set (std: $0.46 -> $0.54)
- Panel volatility may reflect fewer countries smoothing outliers

---

## Next Steps

1. If nominal CHIP tracks inflation -> proceed to formal H1 testing
2. If stable panel is smoother -> use it as default country set
3. If rolling average helps -> adopt 3yr or 5yr window for production
4. Compare GDP vs labor vs unweighted (change WEIGHTING constant)
5. Investigate anomalous years / country-count changes
