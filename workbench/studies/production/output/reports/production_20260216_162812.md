## Phase 2: Trailing Window Comparison

| Window | Mean Nominal | YoY Std | Smoothness Rank |
|--------|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| 5-year | $2.57 | 5.0% | 1 |
| 3-year | $2.58 | 6.8% | 2 |
| 1-year | $2.58 | 20.1% | 3 |

**Recommended window: 5-year** (lowest year-over-year volatility)

## Phase 3: PWT Bridge (frozen at 2020)

| Year | Truth | Freeze | Freeze Err | Slope | Slope Err |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| 2021 | $3.06 | $2.83 | -7.6% | $2.80 | -8.6% |
| 2022 | $2.69 | $2.42 | -10.2% | $2.45 | -9.0% |

**Freeze bridge:** mean |error| = 8.9%, max = 10.2%
**Slope bridge:** mean |error| = 8.8%, max = 9.0%

**Recommended: slope bridge** (8.8% mean error)

## Current CHIP Estimate

**Latest calculated year:** 2022
- Single-year constant: $2.69/hr
- Single-year nominal: $3.17/hr
- 5-year trailing nominal: $3.27/hr (at 2022)

To estimate current CHIP, multiply the trailing-window value by
cumulative CPI growth since the last calculated year:

```
CHIP_current = $3.27 × (CPI_today / CPI_2022)
```

For reference: chipcentral.net reports $3.18 (based on original study
$2.53 × CPI adjustment). Our 2022 single-year nominal is $3.17.

## Preliminary Recommendations

1. Use a **5-year trailing window** for production estimates.
2. Use **slope bridge** for years beyond PWT (mean error 8.8%).
3. CPI extrapolation correction std: 6.4% — acceptable for interim estimates.
4. Latest nominal CHIP (2022): **$3.17/hr**. Extrapolate with CPI for current value.
